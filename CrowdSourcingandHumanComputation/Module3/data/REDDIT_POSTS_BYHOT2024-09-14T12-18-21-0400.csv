pinoybigbrother,1fgl8zp,DEBATE,"finally out, okay so sino ngayon ang below the belt? BOTH. sino nauna? HMM.

not siding with anyone, they are clearly BOTH AT FAULT. but see how much hate jas is getting just because of those vids circulating online? Not defending Jas. I'm very disappointed at her for stooping that low sa debate. As well as kay fyang. Not tolerating any of it. But the hate was so intense parang di naman naglelevel sa kung ano nakikita natin rn.

pinoybigbrother,1fgoucl,jas vs fyang debate,"as much as I didn‚Äôt like how jas started to take things personally, i still felt bad for her. she was pressured by dylan, thinking they would all do the same. yet, lahat sila bigla naging soft and mabait sa teens. biruin mo, napagusapan pala nila not to show mercy sa teens tapos lahat sila parang iniwan si jas sa ere. 

but i also really can‚Äôt blame fyang. naiintindihan ko sya bc i‚Äôm also a firm believer na you shouldn‚Äôt start what you can‚Äôt finish. kung ikaw ang unang nanakit sakin, ibabalik ko lang din yan sayo to give you a taste of your own medicine. kita rin naman na it was cut. based sa usapan ng adults sa livestream, dinamay raw talaga ni jas ang family and education ni fyang na hindi naman pinalabas sa episode tonight. and based din sa message ni fyang to jas. 

also, napansin ko lang, she rlly felt competition with fyang nung sinabi nyang ‚Äúsaka hindi ko naman ni-chain si jm, kasi sya mismo ang lumalapit sakin‚Äùüò≠ like was she really comparing herself with jm vs fyang with jm this whole timeeeeüò≠

Popping back in.  Rushed this little piece together because of the debate.   Everything was business as usual.  People eating kittens and dogs,  huge crowds,  Christian nationalism,  and nothing on the environmental crises.  Nothing. 

I think the most we got was Kamala saying, ""it is an existential threat"". Then nothing else.  Nothing.   Well, this little cartoon or painting or whatever related to collapse because of the above statements. 

That's it for the week. Short and sweet.

Life is worth living at the end of the world.   For real, it's a great show and we're all in it.

MarkMyWords,1fgeocm,MMW The Second Debate is already Checkmate for MAGA,"The first debate was about introducing people to Kamala and humiliating Trump. Now that all of the mud slinging is out of the way, the second debate is going to be highly focused on policy. I see three outcomes coming from the second debate. 

1. Fox or other networks will reach out to both campaigns for a second debate. Trump will turn down the offer which means he concedes 90 minutes to Kamala Harris who can then talk about her policies. If he does this then MAGA can't use the attack line of ""well she didn't show up to the September 3rd debate on Fox"" that Trump sprung on her like an anime challenge. This will give voters who are unfamiliar with her policies a resource. 

2. Both Trump and Kamala agree to the debate but Trump backs out at the last minute. If he does this then the election's already over. Trump will spin this and save face with his base but a base doesn't win elections. independent, moderates, and other influential voters will see Trump as a coward. 

3. Both Trump and Kamala show up to the debate. If that happens and this debate is about policy then Trump will perform way worse than in the first debate. Getting Trump to talk about policy against Kamala is a recipe for disaster.

centrist,1ffjn7v,Regarding the debate,"I just watched the whole thing. I'll be blunt, Kamala won me over. I was surprised how much I liked her. I think the main thing is that she talks like a universalist - her answer on race really stood out to me. She framed it as being about what we have in common as human beings. She could have gotten on a big high horse about her particular racial identities, but she didn't do that. That sort of inclusive rhetoric is so important for our incredibly diverse country. Yes, she had awkward issues, like inflation and the border. I just thought she seemed more reasonable, and less pessimistic, and more like she cares about what I care about. I think she's right that we need to stand by Ukraine. I like that she's talked so much about support for small business. (I'm considering starting my second company soon, so this is personal for me.) It doesn't mean Trump has no good ideas - I think he's right that we should enforce our border much more robustly. (In spite of his hypocritically killing the bipartisan border bill.) I think he's right that we've done free trade in a way that didn't consider the needs of American workers or of the country to maintain capabilities like semiconductors and manufacturing. (Thankfully the CHIPS act was passed which moves in that direction.)

I think there's also a generational element - as an elder Millennial, there just seems to be less of a gap between me and Kamala Harris.

I guess I'm sappy but there were two times when what the vice president said brought tears to my eyes. It was just what I regard as traditional American values---freedom, equal protection for all citizens, things like that.

Trump---he seemed like he was so miserable. I honestly think all of this is bad for him.

neoliberal,1fgm4y6,"/r/neoliberal elects: Polish edition - Part 11, Presidential election, 2010.","Hello friends, welcome to the weekly election round-up. A day late this time because of a Palestine-related debacle. (Man, it's always Israel and Palestine). But first, the results from last week:

1. **Left and Democrats - 42,9%**¬†**- 6 votes - 196 seats.**
2. **Civic Platform - 35,7% - 5 votes - 165 seats.**
3. **Polish People's Party - 21,4% - 3 votes - 99 seats.**

None of the parties won more than the 230 seats needed to form a government. The PSL got a record result this week and will decide who's going to rule Poland. I think they would prefer the PO to the left. A PO-PSL coalition is actually the historic outcome of this election. (Although PiS was the main opposition party). I don't know who the prime minister would be, since Donald Tusk, who was the prime minister in real life at the time, is the president.

He would probably run for re-election, but I like to keep the candidates historically accurate, so Komorowski will be the PO candidate this week. Enough of the commentary, let's get straight to the rules.

Debate and discussion in the comments is highly encouraged. Voting from the perspective of not knowing ""the future"" (2024 hindsight) is also welcome, but it's understandable that hindsight may enter into some of the discussion. Whether candidates are considered ""major"" enough to be included in the poll will be largely at my discretion, and will depend on things like whether they actually end up garnering a meaningful amount of votes. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, I'll hold a second round.

I will post one episode every Friday afternoon in my country.

The following two sections have been written by ChatGPT.

# Situation during and before the campaign

Poland in 2010 is navigating a complex political and social landscape, marked by deep divisions between conservative nationalism and pro-European liberalism. The tragic Smolensk plane crash in April, which claimed the life of President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski along with many key Polish officials, has cast a long shadow over the country. This event shook the nation to its core and set the stage for an emotionally charged presidential election. The fallout from the crash has galvanized national debate on everything from foreign relations with Russia to the future of Poland‚Äôs democracy and identity.

The Polish economy is faring well compared to much of Europe, but there are persistent concerns about unemployment and income inequality, particularly in rural areas. Poland‚Äôs position within the European Union continues to be a defining issue, with a clear divide between those who favor deeper integration and modernization and those who push back against perceived erosion of Polish sovereignty and traditional values. With the presidency now vacant, this election serves as a referendum on Poland‚Äôs direction: will it continue to follow a path of conservative nationalism, or pivot towards more liberal, pro-European governance?

# The Major Candidates

**Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski** is the acting president and candidate from the **Civic Platform (PO)**, a centrist, pro-European party. Komorowski, a 58-year-old historian and former defense minister, stepped into the presidential role following Lech Kaczy≈Ñski‚Äôs death as Marshal of the Sejm. He presents himself as a steady, moderate leader who will continue the policies of his party, focusing on economic modernization, greater integration with the European Union, and preserving democratic institutions. Civic Platform has been at the forefront of Poland‚Äôs pro-EU, liberal reform movement, and Komorowski‚Äôs candidacy appeals to urban, progressive voters who support open markets and social freedoms. His leadership style is pragmatic, and he represents stability in a moment of national mourning.

**Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski**, the twin brother of the late Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and leader of the conservative **Law and Justice Party (PiS)**, has entered the race in the wake of his brother's death. At 61 years old, Jaros≈Çaw is a veteran politician with a deep well of support among conservative, rural, and nationalist voters. His candidacy is infused with a sense of personal mission to continue his brother‚Äôs legacy, emphasizing Polish sovereignty, traditional Catholic values, and skepticism of deeper European integration. Kaczy≈Ñski's platform focuses on restoring Poland‚Äôs moral and cultural identity, pushing back against liberalism, and strengthening the state‚Äôs role in economic management. The tragedy of the Smolensk crash has amplified his rhetoric, and he frames this election as a choice between defending Poland‚Äôs independence and submitting to foreign influence.

**Grzegorz Napieralski** of the **Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)** represents Poland‚Äôs left-wing constituency. Napieralski, 36 years old and relatively young in the Polish political landscape, advocates for social democracy, including stronger welfare programs, workers' rights, and progressive policies. SLD has historically represented the post-communist left, though its influence has waned since the early 2000s. Napieralski aims to bring the party back to relevance, appealing to voters who are disillusioned with both the conservative nationalism of PiS and the economic liberalism of PO. His base consists of urban, working-class voters and those who remain nostalgic for the social safety net of Poland‚Äôs communist past.

I testified to the nlrb with a couple of my other co workers. I dont know now whats going to happen to me or the other 2 guys. We are trying for a cemax ruling now but who knows on that.

I'll link to a better source when I find one. I'm sorry my summaries are probably quite biased, but the legislature this year...

* Amendment A - Would allow the legislature to spend income tax on anything they see fit; in exchange they promise to end the food tax. The food tax can be removed by the legislature at any time, but they are anchoring its removal to removing the guardrail that guarantees income taxes go toward education.
* Amendment B - also relates to school funding
* Amendment C - Shall the Utah Constitution be amended to have the office of county sheriff be elected by
voters? (note: good job, legislature, that's actually neutral language!)
* Amendment D - An amendment to get citizens to give up their right to reform the government in exchange for... well, nothing. This amendment has been found by the courts to be invalid and while it will appear on your ballot, the amendment [is void](https://www.fox13now.com/news/politics/judge-rules-amendment-d-will-not-appear-on-november-ballot).

Presidentialpoll,1ffi69v,1964 Bavarian Landtag Election | Peacock-Shah Alternate Election,"Bavaria found itself under French control after France completed its invasion of Germany in 1940 and quickly became an economic engine for the French Empire. Following 16 years of French rule seeing dirigist economic policies to fuel the French war machine and deporting Jews to France where their fates are ostensibly unknown, Bavaria would successfully break free in the European Spring in 1956 while the rest of Germany found itself still at the mercy of Charles De Gaulle. With no hope of standing independently, Bavaria‚Äôs emergency leaders would become a component republic of the Habsburg Empire. With the ruling Bavarian People‚Äôs Party bringing Christian Democracy to Bavaria, its policies would be put on the ballot after 8 years of governance.

The BPP has pursued massive tax cuts and privatization from the French-aligned dirigiste policies combined with opposing all price controls which some say has led to Bavaria‚Äôs newfound economic growth and mass expansion of infrastructure. The BPP has fully aligned itself with the Catholic Church, granting it special status within society, and has appeased social corporatists by designing the Landtag to represent specific segments of society including farmers' organizations, middle-class professionals, the Church, nobles, and some union representatives. Schaffer has been criticized for not expanding the money supply from both sides and is also criticized for not funding the Bavarian military, although he has tolerated the build-up of veterans‚Äô organizations such as *Der Stahlhelm.*

**Free Democratic Party:** 

*""The Bavarian people must not lose faith in itself and be firmly confident in the Democratic idea.""*

The FDP stands as the most clearly liberal party on both social and economic matters. The FDP advocates for continued reduction of regulations, taxes, and spending while also advocating for expanding the money supply. They also call for abolishing the death penalty, removing ties to the Catholic Church, liberalizing the legal system, and ending the corporatist legislature. The party is the strongest supporter of the current Habsburg Empire and stands opposed to remilitarization. The party is deeply divided on opinion towards French collaborators with party leader Thomas Dehler taking a hardline against collaborationists while others in the party support total reconciliation. Due to the party‚Äôs secular and libertarian ideas, the party is expected to do poorly.

**National Democratic Party:** 

*""Deutschland uber alles.""* 

By far the most controversial party, the National Democrats are led by the controversial and, allegedly, mentally ill Alfred Loritz who some have compared to ex-Nazi Party Leader Ernst Rohm in his public charisma. The party‚Äôs proposals are centered on Loritz above all, but it is clearly on the political right. Loritz himself has limited connections to the French-aligned regime, but the party's rank-in-file is filled with bureaucrats and officers of the old regime. The party stands most clearly as apologists for the French regime and demands the end of the Habsburg Empire in favor of a Pan-German state consisting of Bavaria and Austria with hopes it will encompass Germany as a whole one day. The party is also vaguely tied to a set of typical populist policies including expanding pensions, continued public works programs, and a welfare state, and also opposes the capitalist framework of the BPP and has previously criticized the Catholic Church. The NDP is dogged by the issue of anti-semitism with the aging Herman Goering and others as featured speakers as Goering has attempted to deflect on the issue by saying *‚ÄúI decide who is a Jew‚Äù* while others openly call for expelling or attacking the limited Jewish population.

**Social Democratic Party:** 

*""Against monarchy, fascism, and communism.""*

The Social Democrats are historically weak in Bavaria but are hoping to use right-wing division to their advantage. Despite a more radical beginning in 1956, the SDP has moderated on accepting capitalism and has ignored price controls focusing on a welfare state and loosening the money supply to expand employment. The party is also strongly anti-Communist and has attempted to distance itself from the KPD while still criticizing the political Catholicism of the current Government and corporatist legislature. The Social Democrats support the current framework of the Habsburg Empire, but, are divided on if the military should be expanded. Nonetheless, the party has accepted tripartite corporatism as an economic model while accusing the BPP of ignoring workers. While on the backburner, the party also supports various social liberalization policies on divorce, legal rights, and animal welfare.

**Bavarian National People‚Äôs Party:** 

*""Heil dir im Seigerkranz.""* 

With the aging, but, enormously popular Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck at the helm, the BNVP has offered a vision between the BPP and NPD. Most uniquely, the party calls for the restoration of the House of Wittelsbach in a constitutional capacity. The BNVP has broadly supported mainstream conservatism and has advocated for continued implementation of lower taxes while arguing, from a Bismarckian perspective, the social role of the state in a welfare system (with the BNVP suggesting the Army‚Äôs role in such matters, as was done by Von Schleicher) and arguing for cooperation as opposed to anti-trust regulations in industry. The party is also committed to the current corporatist legislative structure and the role of the Catholic Church in society, although the party is more open to Protestants than the BPP. Nonetheless, the party is also clearly affiliated with *Der Stahlhelm,* advocates for the rapid expansion of the Bavarian military, and is filled with former French-aligned officers who nonetheless have advocated maintaining the Habsburg Empire as the only course even as they are known to be personally Germanic nationalist.

**Communist Party of Bavaria/Germany:** 

*""Class against class.""*

Briefly taking over Germany amid the Depression, the KPD would instead be buried by successive regimes with Von Schleicher, Petain, De Gaulle, and even the liberal King Otto I supporting measures to destroy the party infrastructure. However, the still republican values in Bavaria would allow the KPD to continue in the province, even as De Gaulle stamped them out in the rest of Germany. Nonetheless, the party still exists to advocate for attempting to launch a 2nd European Spring in Bavaria to spread across Central Europe and break the Franco-Habsburg duopoly over the Continent. With Lazar Kaganovich condemning Bukharinism and Trotskyism, the Kaganovichists would maintain the clearest hold over the party with the KPD often bickering internally more than they do towards other parties. Nonetheless, following the Kaganovich line, the party has faced most of its fire towards the SPD dubbing them *‚Äúsocial Howardites.‚Äù* The KPD is also hampered by the fact that many of its leaders have gone to Soviet Russia, but, have never left after seemingly deviating from the party line. The party‚Äôs prospects are focused on attempting to rally support among unions as well as win international support for the Party in future elections or demonstrations.

NinePennyKings,1fg8v51,Election of High Septon ,"The election began with Septon Lucian stepping forward. ""The Father‚Äôs justice must be spread beyond these walls, into the darkest corners of the realm. I have traveled far, seen the barbarism of the North, the Ironborn. It is time for the Faith to stand firm in judgment."" His voice was strong, commanding attention.

Septon Percival snorted. ""Justice? You speak of justice, but where is your purity? You‚Äôve mingled too long with heathens. The Faith needs cleansing, not expansion."" He turned to the council, eyes narrowing. ""We need a High Septon who will restore humility through sacrifice.""

Septon Cassian leaned back, fingers brushing his chin. ""Humility is a virtue, indeed, but wisdom dictates balance. Harsh measures alienate. We must guide, not cast away. I stand for a united Faith, tempered with compassion."" His calm voice drew nods from the council, even as Lucian‚Äôs face twisted with frustration.

As the first vote was cast, murmurs filled the room. Septon Paul, quiet until now, rose. ""The Warrior teaches us that strength lies in defending the weak. I have walked with the Begging Brothers, taught them to wield swords, to stand tall. The Faith Militant must rise again to protect our people.""

Septon Gawain frowned, shaking his head. ""Militancy is not the answer, brother. The people need guidance, not arms. The Faith should lift the fallen, not march into war."" His words were soft but firm.

Septon Cassian interjected smoothly. ""Strength can be found in wisdom. The re-establishment of the Faith Militant would invite conflict, and the realm is fragile. We must build, not tear down."" He met Septon Paul‚Äôs gaze without flinching.

When Cassian secured the Father‚Äôs vote, Septon Lucian clenched his fists, but his frustration was evident. ""This isn‚Äôt over,"" he muttered under his breath.

The Mother‚Äôs vote followed, and Septon Gawain stood once more. ""Compassion must be our guiding light. We are nothing if we do not care for the poor, the hungry, the lost. I offer my life to the service of the smallfolk."" His sincerity was palpable.

Septon Cassian again made his move. ""Compassion without stability breeds chaos. We must nurture the realm, but with a steady hand. Excessive charity without planning will only destabilize the Faith‚Äôs resources."" He spoke with the authority of someone who knew the delicate balance of power.

Septon Percival scowled. ""Stability? Stability comes from piety and suffering. We must endure the trials of the Seven, not shy away from them.""

Cassian‚Äôs calm smile never wavered. ""Endurance must come from wisdom. The Faith must be a rock, not a whip."" The vote went to Cassian.

As the day wore on, the council grew more divided. Septon Paul, rallying again for the Warrior‚Äôs vote, barked, ""We must defend ourselves! The bandits, the outlaws‚Äîthey plague the roads while the Faith stands idle.""

Septon Gawain sighed. ""The Faith is not meant to be an army, brother.""

Septon Cassian, seeing his moment, stood. ""We must find strength through unity, not force. Let the Warrior guide us to build alliances, not walls."" The council nodded again, and the Warrior‚Äôs vote, too, went to Cassian.

Frustration boiled over as Septon Lucian slammed his fist onto the table. ""You would let the realm fall into chaos, Cassian! You sit in your luxury while the rest of us fight for the true Faith.""

Septon Cassian met his gaze evenly. ""I do not fight with swords, brother, but with wisdom. The Crone teaches us to see the way forward clearly, without rashness.""

Lucian leaned forward, his voice a growl. ""Rash? You call defending the Faith rash? You hide behind books and luxury, while I fight!""

Septon Paul chimed in, trying to steady himself, ""Cassian‚Äôs path is too soft. The Faith must stand strong.""

Septon Cassian shook his head. ""Strength without wisdom is folly, brother.""

The council, worn down by the bickering, cast their votes. Cassian won again.

Septon Percival, eyes narrowing, looked around the room. ""You all think too much of luxury and too little of sacrifice. The Maiden‚Äôs purity is found in hardship, not comfort.""

Septon Gawain sighed. ""You seek to bring suffering where none is needed, Percival.""

Septon Cassian again stepped in, his voice like oil over troubled waters. ""The Maiden‚Äôs purity is in understanding, in guiding without cruelty. We must lift others, not grind them down in pointless trials.""

The vote swung toward Cassian once more.

By the time the Smith‚Äôs vote arrived, Septon Paul‚Äôs voice had grown hoarse. ""We must build! Our strength comes from the labor of the people.""

Septon Cassian, ever calm, simply replied, ""Building must be steady, with a foundation in wisdom. Rash construction leads to collapse."" The vote fell to him once more.

Septon Lucian, defeated but not broken, tried for the Crone‚Äôs vote. ""The future is dark, and the Faith needs someone who can lead us through the unknown. I have seen the darkness. I know what‚Äôs out there."" His voice was almost pleading.

Cassian, unshaken, replied, ""The Crone teaches us to seek wisdom, not fear the unknown. We must walk with clear eyes, not trembling hearts.""

The council nodded, and again, the vote went to Cassian.

Septon Lucian‚Äôs final gambit came with the Stranger‚Äôs vote. ""The Stranger walks among us every day. We must embrace the truth of death, the unknown. I am the one who can guide us.""

Septon Cassian simply shook his head. ""The Stranger is not something to be feared but understood. I will guide us through these uncertain times with care, not haste."" The final vote went to him.

With all seven votes cast, Septon Cassian rose. ""The Seven have spoken through you, my brothers and sisters. I accept the mantle of High Septon, not as a victor, but as a servant."" His voice was measured, his eyes scanning the room. ""Together, we will guide the Faith forward, united and strong.""

The Most Devout bowed, reluctantly for some, but Cassian knew the power was now his.",colba2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinePennyKings/comments/1fg8v51/election_of_high_septon/,/r/NinePennyKings/comments/1fg8v51/election_of_high_septon/,0,2024-09-13 23:39:41,14,,False,1.0,Lore,2024-09-14 12:17:33.992739

akmgeopolitics,1fgfm3h,Prediction ‚Äì 2024 US Presential Election,"The US 2024 presidential election and its lead-up have been fascinating. In many ways, this should be a landslide, much like the UK elections. On one side, you have a convicted felon, a convicted rapist, a conspiracy theorist, and a fascist. On the other, you have a law enforcer. It should be an obvious choice. Yet, not only is it far from that, but there‚Äôs a very real possibility that the felon could win. Trump could become the president once again.

There have been numerous predictions on the outcome of this race. My goal is to share my thoughts on what might happen on November 5th but, more importantly, to explain why I feel that way. The prediction itself may be wrong, but the rationale matters. I'm eager to discuss the data supporting my view and hear what readers think.

Prediction: Harris will win the 2024 presidential election with a convincing victory. Texas and Florida might be in play. This loss will force the Republican Party to reassess its strategy and identity, potentially redefining itself in a post-Trump era.

Below, I outline the key reasons I believe this will happen. I'll also touch on why Trump could win, but even in that scenario, I don‚Äôt see a landslide in his favor. If Trump wins, it will be by a narrow margin. It‚Äôs worth noting that my thinking is not based on polls, approval ratings, or debate performances. Having studied a bit of history, I have come to the conclusion that these factors matter very little. I explain that in greater detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1eufo7l/polls\_approval\_ratings\_and\_debates\_do\_they\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1eufo7l/polls_approval_ratings_and_debates_do_they_matter/)

Factors that favor Harris:

* Trump has been the worst president in American history‚Äîa felon, a rapist, anti-abortion, a champion of the wealthy, an environmental threat, an insurrectionist, a wannabe dictator and much more. None of this is something I have made up ‚Äì it is all in the public doman for anyone to see. I talk about this in greater detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1e7nuox/why\_trump\_is\_the\_worst\_us\_president\_and\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1e7nuox/why_trump_is_the_worst_us_president_and_his/)
* Harris inherits Biden‚Äôs legacy. Biden has arguably been the best president in the past 50 years, maybe since JFK. He took on the reigns of the country at a very tough time and has done a solid job during his 4 years. He received a lot of flak for his debate performance. But I think his biggest issue was his inability to communicate this achievements to the public. I write more about Biden‚Äôs legacy here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1ea0l5u/the\_biden\_legacy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1ea0l5u/the_biden_legacy/)
* While the Democratic Party and its supporters appear relatively unified, the Republican Party is notably fractured. This split is largely due to Trump‚Äôs departure from traditional conservative values. The Republican Party includes diverse factions such as big businesses, the religious right, national security advocates, libertarians, and centrists. Trump‚Äôs record‚Äîmarked by multiple marriages, affairs with porn stars, and a lack of biblical knowledge‚Äîalienates the religious right. His approach to national security and his disregard for senior military officials and veterans, further distance him from national security advocates. Meanwhile, as Harris moves toward the center, Trump continues to drift further to the right, highlighting a growing rift between Trumpism and traditional conservatism. To learn more about the factions, click here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1el9j2r/the\_republican\_party\_evolution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1el9j2r/the_republican_party_evolution/)
* Gender demographics: Women make up about 52% of the electorate, and I find it hard to see how they could support a candidate who is determined to take away their reproductive rights. I suspect there‚Äôs a silent pro-Harris vote among women, particularly in red states. These women might tell their controlling husbands that they will vote for Trump, but instead vote for Harris.
* Voter demographics: The American electorate is roughly composed of 30-35% Democrats, 35-40% independents, and 30% Republicans. While it‚Äôs expected that Republicans and Democrats will largely vote along party lines, independents represent the critical swing group that will likely determine the election's outcome. In the 2022 midterms, independents‚Äîtypically less likely to vote‚Äîturned out in significant numbers and largely opposed Republicans, preventing the anticipated ""red wave."" Democrats retained the Senate with independent support, while Republicans secured the House by a narrow margin. Given Trump‚Äôs increasingly extreme positions since 2022, it‚Äôs difficult to see independents shifting in his favor.

Factors that favor Trump:

* Trump is an old white male, fitting the stereotype of what many Americans expect in a president.
* Harris is a Black woman, and sadly, many Americans may not be ready to accept that. The belief that ""being president is a man‚Äôs job"" still lingers in parts of the electorate. Don‚Äôt believe me - see this: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Akki\_Mukri\_Keswani/comments/1fa7lb7/a\_maga\_supporter\_is\_asked\_can\_a\_woman\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Akki_Mukri_Keswani/comments/1fa7lb7/a_maga_supporter_is_asked_can_a_woman_be/)
* Election interference: It‚Äôs evident that both Putin and Netanyahu have a vested interest in seeing Trump win and are likely to attempt to interfere with the election. Domestically, troubling developments like Georgia‚Äôs new election rules could jeopardize democratic integrity by permitting partisan influence in certifying election results. For a deeper dive into these concerns, see here: - [https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1f2a4ki/georgias\_election\_a\_threat\_to\_democracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/akmgeopolitics/comments/1f2a4ki/georgias_election_a_threat_to_democracy/)
* Voter Perceptions: On July 13, after Trump was shot, a friend of mine posted in our college WhatsApp group with a picture of Trump bleeding and punching the air, declaring, ‚ÄúTrump has won the election.‚Äù Later, following Trump‚Äôs poor debate performance, the same friend posted, ‚ÄúLooks like Harris is going to win.‚Äù Initially, I dismissed his comments as superficial, based on limited headlines and social media snippets. However, this made me realize that many voters may approach decisions similarly‚Äîrelying on minimal information or the latest news cycle. This tendency could potentially benefit Trump, who maintains a constant media presence and is always out there
* Lastly, I might be wrong about all of the above. Perhaps Trump was a solid president, Biden was ineffective, and the issues I‚Äôve outlined simply don‚Äôt resonate with voters. My bias might be clouding my judgment, making it hard to see the other side's perspective.

But here‚Äôs the crux: even if I‚Äôm wrong and Trump wins, a significant portion of America will remain deeply unsettled. The nation‚Äôs divisions will only widen, as Trump‚Äôs approach offers no vision for unity.

America will find itself more fractured than ever before.

Law_and_Politics,1fgh4ju,Republicans will fall away from Trump‚Äôs base before the election ,"Question?
How do you win an election when 60%-65% of all women and 80%-85% of people of color vote for the other candidate? (That‚Äôs not even counting the other voters he‚Äôs lost including REPUBLICANS because of Jan 6 and on and on.)
Answer: You can‚Äôt.

What sane person would go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things Trump did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

What sane person would appear on the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

What sane person would go on a debate stage in front of the world and refuse to support Poland in the war against Russian aggression?

Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let‚Äôs be honest. Trump needs every vote he can get and yet he is even alienating his own base.

Trump has done nothing but reinforce the opinions of people who believe him to be crazy.

Now that Trump has proven to most Americans he is crazy, many Republicans have disassociated themselves. Typically these Republicans want to make it clear they aren‚Äôt MAGA. 

More and more, people don‚Äôt want to be known as someone who supported Trump. Who can blame them?  People think Trump is crazy and so what does that say about his supporters?

Mark my words, after Trump loses the election in November it won‚Äôt be long before Trump supporters will deny they supported Trump.

They will be telling their family and friends that they knew some MAGA people who overdosed on Trump but they weren‚Äôt a part of those crazy folks.",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1fgh4ju/republicans_will_fall_away_from_trumps_base/,/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1fgh4ju/republicans_will_fall_away_from_trumps_base/,13,2024-09-14 07:59:13,60,,False,0.93,None,2024-09-14 12:17:33.992739

the_everything_bubble,1fgpfoq,Trump is no longer trying to win the election,"
The word is out.  Trump is no longer trying to win the election.

It‚Äôs very obvious now that Trump is not trying to win the election.

Why else would he go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things he did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let‚Äôs be honest.  Trump wants to lose.  Why else would he go on a the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

 He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Why else would he go on a debate stage and refuse to support Poland against Russia‚Äôs aggression in Ukraine?

He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Trump knows he‚Äôs going to lose but he is using his air time to make a push for another run in the entertainment industry.  Trump will be a consultant in a movie about his political career.

He won‚Äôt play himself.  Instead the role of Trump will go to Ric Flair, the ex-professional wrestler known as the ‚Äúdirtiest wrestler‚Äù in the game.

Flair was very popular for his bleached blond hair and carnival barking style.  Thousands of wrestling fans believed his act was real and they adored him much like Trump supporters adore Trump.

Dolly Parton is being courted to star as Stormy Daniels, the American pornographic film actress and former stripper.

Trump‚Äôs extras in the movie will be picked in a pecking order with the first opportunities going to the ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù who attacked the Capitol.

The secondary roles will go to former MAGAs who were not part of the attack but supported MAGA.

MAGA movie extra hopefuls will have to bring a red MAGA cap to be considered as an extra for the movie: ‚ÄúTrump. He did it his Way.‚Äù",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,2,2024-09-14 16:02:47,4,,False,1.0,POLITICS,2024-09-14 12:17:33.992739

The funniest part of this all is that, prior to this, during my annual performance evaluation, my manager indicated that I am doing amazing but since there is no business need for a level 4 position right now, I cannot he promoted.

I have no idea who is running so I opened up the internet and was greeted by this, I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting to see an exact copy paste word diarrhoea from American politics here but there it is. 

Is this just becoming the norm that we are adopting the crazy American lead paint enthusiast obsessions?

I've tried going to career fairs and applying for begginner accounting roles like account clerk. I've had no luck thus far. These are the questions I have and I would appreciate all advice, especially the brutally honest ones:
1. What are the main things that need to be on my resume so I am able to get my foot in the door to meet the practical experience requirements for PERT?
2. What should I  be applying for?
3. What else should I be doing? 
These are just some questions I have to get started. Thanks for your responses!

I'm seeking advice on how to secure a higher-level marketing position, such as a manager or senior executive, within the next few years.

My main experience includes all types of copywriting.  Besides that, I've done offer creation, funnel management, and campaign leadership. I also have basic design skills and approximately six months of combined media buying experience.

I've noticed that many job descriptions in my desired roles require strong media buying and performance marketing skills.   
  
To strengthen my qualifications, I'm considering taking a lower-paying entry-level or mid-level media buying position for a year or two.

What are your thoughts on this?

PS: I'd appreciate your guidance on the following:

* How can I enhance my resume to highlight my skills and experience?
* What specific types of jobs should I target next that will be a stepping stone?

srilanka,1fghfnc,What is your priority this election and which candidate best aligns with what YOU want?,"Since the election is closing in,  I want to know what the reddit demographic of Sri Lankans mainly care about this election. 

Me personally, my primary focus is on the economy, paying off debt, promoting foreign investment, privatising government owned businesses and keeping inflation under control. So far inflation is at 0.5% down from 44% last year which is honestly amazing. 

So far the candidate who aligns best with what I PERSONALLY WANT is RW. That's just MY OPINION (strong emphasis on the word opinion because this is reddit). 

SP has a good educated cabinet, but this is the presidential election not the government election and I frankly do not think that he is a good leader.

AKD I wouldn't vote because he is a career Marxist who believes in Marxist principles. I don't think his diplomatic capabilities are nearly as good as Ranil's, his policies are all just words, not talking about how exactly he's going to achieve it and if he does mention how he is going to achieve it often falls apart when you look at it quantitatively. Ex:- He stays he will increase government revenue by cutting government spending and pensions for MPs but when you look at it as a percentage of the entire government revenue its a very small percentage and sadly plenty of people fall for these emotional statements. He's changed his stance multiple times on the IMF. he went from we don't need the IMF to all of a sudden accepting the IMF. his fellow Dr. Harshana said in a debate that he wants to make the treasury apolitical and independent. How can the government pass policies if the treasury is made independent? Sounds like economic and political illiteracy. 

In my view RW is not afraid of taking unpopular decisions that is better for the country. Look at the revised tax brackets, no one likes it but it was something that had to be done. If you say it didn't need to be done you're gonna have to provide an alternative with detailed quantitative figures as to how revenue can be raised without doing that.

So far the way I see it, the only pitch for AKD is
1. He has never been given a chance
2. He is supposedly going to get rid of corruption.

I genuinely don't see any other reason. Again this is all my OPINION. I know my views aren't gonna be very popular on reddit but I want YOUR feedback too. What is your priority this election, why you disagree with me and why you think the candidate you support is better for the job.

Keep it respectful and argument based.",clumsyninja92,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1fghfnc/what_is_your_priority_this_election_and_which/,/r/srilanka/comments/1fghfnc/what_is_your_priority_this_election_and_which/,22,2024-09-14 08:21:54,13,,False,0.76,Politics,2024-09-14 12:17:35.829794

FireEmblemHeroes,1fgnna5,Predicting the remaining Grand Hero Battle candidates: Day 4: Thracia 776,"The results from Genealogy are Manfroy, Bloom, Ishtore, Lombard, Chulainn, Beowolf, and a four way tie between Aida, Chagall, Reptor and Hannibal. It should be noted Manfroy was well in the lead with 20 votes. Ishtore is the one that surprises me, guess people like the Ishtar connection. Also surprised Lombard is so far ahead of Reptor, guess people want to see a Helswath user more than the duo with the slightly larger plot focus. Now, on to Thracia 776.  


**NPC**  
\*Dryas  
\*Raydrik  


**Playable Enemies**  
\*Marty  
\*Lifis  
\*Dalsin  
\*Shiva  
\*Fred  
\*Troude  
\*Ilios  
\*Misha  
\*Shannam  
\*Xavier  
\*Amalda  
\*Conomor  




Thracia is in a situation quite like Archanea with only one proper enemy left, Raydrik. Though there's a decent chance of seeing Dryas since they've already put August in (August was a banner unit though, so they might follow suit). He only has one arm in terms of canon which would be interesting to see on a sprite. Anyway, the majority of GHB units will be playable enemies, so the focus would largely be on which. 31 playable units to get into Thracia so this vote is set to 8 again.

I only faltered on one question which was what instruments can be used for low temp sterilization. 


Overall i did alright but The manager didn‚Äôt seem to be an all natural upbeat guy.  all the hope i got was ‚Äúyou will hear from me next week regardless if you get the job or not‚Äù and some follow up questions related to my experience. He also wanted to know about my availability in detail.

But they weren't, because at least they wrote their own work! To use chatgpt is one thing, to not even be bothered to read and edit the answer it generates is another.

Why bother? It's so unprofessional.I know we're all busy but if you can't even write a statement, what makes you think you should represent people. It just hit me that this has been annoying me.

Sorry if you are one of the decent candidates, there was still plenty of quality, and I hope the vote reflected that.

Defeat_Project_2025,1fglv2v,Update: YouTube has removed my entire channel exposing MAGA and Trump,"I won‚Äôt be appealing it. The channel served its purpose, and I‚Äôm grateful for the support it received while active for less than a week, during which it garnered nearly 10,000 views. Thank you all for sharing and keeping the message alive‚Äîthere are still plenty of YouTube links circulating and doing well. 

I want to make something clear: this is what I anticipated. I knew MAGA‚Äôs violent suppression of free speech, which they ironically claim to defend, would backfire. It‚Äôs the Streisand Effect in action‚Äîby trying to silence the truth, they‚Äôve only amplified it. That's also why I chose to use their own platform, **Odysee**, against them. It‚Äôs even more humiliating for them to see their ideology exposed on a platform they consider a safe space, proving they can‚Äôt escape the truth, no matter where they turn. 

We have to stay steps ahead of them, no longer in denial or ignorance of their tactics. This demonstrates their cult-like behavior, shutting down anything that challenges their dangerous ideology.

When we **fight**‚Äî we win.

For those looking for the videos, here are the updated links:

* **The video exposing MAGA extremists** (previously mass-reported): [Watch it on Odysee](https://odysee.com/2024-06-03-08-02-46:8).
* **The Kamala Harris video** (which was taken down along with the channel): [Watch it on Odysee](https://odysee.com/Fully-Charged:8).

Feel free to download and share them far and wide. As long as they're useful tools I'll be sure they're available for download somewhere. These videos may have a limited shelf life, but according to feedback from thousands of comments I have read over the past 3 months, they resonate deeply and strike the right chord at this time.",brainser,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1fglv2v/update_youtube_has_removed_my_entire_channel/,/r/Defeat_Project_2025/comments/1fglv2v/update_youtube_has_removed_my_entire_channel/,82,2024-09-14 13:18:32,1187,,False,0.97,None,2024-09-14 12:17:36.886578

For anyone who doesn't know, she's a hardcore alt-right Internet personality and Trump sycophant who has a laundry list of ridiculous shit that she's done to bolster the far-right agenda in recent years. She's a truly horrible person with disgusting and dangerous views.

Her coaching most definitely led to the ""they're eating the dawgs!"" moment, along with many other golden lines that came from Trump during the debate. She has really cozied up to Trump recently and it's starting to draw some speculation that the two are having some kind of love affair behind the scenes (although I think it's just a rumor at this point).

I find this interesting, especially in light of the cult expert that David recently had on the program. Several years ago I became really fascinated by Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple and read several books and watched a few documentaries on the topic. There are many parallels between Donald and Jim Jones. One of the more prominent similarities is how Jim Jones knew he was a phony and simply pandered to whatever group of people would give him the most attention. Chief among them was his ""inner circle"", primarily made up of middle class white young adults from the San Francisco bay area who were deeply interested in Jim Jones' political activism. These people had a much better quality of life than the rest of Peoples Temple members, who were overwhelmingly working class and black. Among this inner circle were several young, attractive women that Jones was known to have taken on as mistresses. It was later reported that Jones sexually assaulted many women and men within Peoples Temple, but there were a few women in particular that Jones favored. This was made more obvious when Peoples Temple went to Guyana and his personal life was more visible to the Temple members. His primary mistress was Maria Katsaris - someone who was deeply loyal to Jones and would literally do anything for him. Unlike some members of the Inner Circle, she truly believed in the lies and bullshit that Jones preached. She was a major influence in the final act of Revolutionary Suicide that the group is most infamous for. She was a true zealot who killed others and herself just to please Jim Jones.

I guess all this is suffice to say that I wonder if Trump is starting to go down that road with Laura Loomer. Melania seems to be virtually out of the picture these days, and Trump has been on record as being quite touchy with Loomer and complimenting her appearance. Trump, like Jim Jones, has a constant need to feel worshiped by people and showered with adoration. Loomer is giving him that attention, and as a result he seems to be turning into her little puppet - saying all the things she wants him to. We know he is easily manipulated by people who give him the adoration that he wants. Regardless of whether there is ""something more"" there or not, I find it interesting that this latest chapter of the Trump saga seems to be focusing in on Loomer and her involvement in his life.",DoctorWinchester87,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/1fg3y4t/trump_and_laura_loomer/,/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/1fg3y4t/trump_and_laura_loomer/,72,2024-09-13 19:58:54,151,,False,0.96,2024 Election,2024-09-14 12:17:36.886578

YAPms,1ffz7m0,I don't believe Kamala Harris' campaign - nor Harris herself - believes she will win this election,"Although the mood in her camp is positive following Tuesday's Presidential debate, the broader vibe check I have noticed for about a week or so now has been a resignation to the fact that the Vice President is up against it this November.

What seals this belief for me, are today's comments from Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself. Kamala referred to her bid as ""the underdog"", saying in North Carolina today, ""Make no mistake: we are the underdog in this election.""

**I do not take this** to be a modest, precautionary warning to the base to not be complacent, but that the campaign probably knows something most of us don't - which is that the internal data is stupidly tight, more than we could guess.

Harris seems to be aware the fundamentals of the race favor Donald Trump, and I'm inclined to agree.

She did not get a Convention bounce. And although most viewers felt she won Tuesday night's exchange on the stage with her opponent, we will not truly know for at least another week if that results in an uptick for her in the areas where she needs them.

I also believe that most viewers barely know anything more about her after the debate. Many, many, MANY are saying they don't understand her policies - or even know what they are. **They wish she had fleshed them out more**. In this regard, I think the Vice President failed on Tuesday. **She needs to do town hall enviornments and interact with voters across the country**. She needs to cris-cross the US relentlessly to make her agenda clear. She may well end up doing all of what she needs, because there seems to be a very sober realization that her circle understands. They seem to believe she is on course to lose unless rapid change happens in this campaign.

Additionally, and this pains me to say this, as someone that loves MN Gov. Tim Walz - I believe his selection as running mate was a mistake. Not that he is a liability on the ticket, but that, with talks of Pennsylvania looking like the deciding State in this Election, she really could have used Josh Shapiro with her, despite any baggage wrt to Israel-Palestine. If PA ends up being ridiculously narrow, Shapiro may well could have proven capable of getting her a few thousand more votes. But that has now passed.",Red_Vines49,https://www.reddit.com/r/YAPms/comments/1ffz7m0/i_dont_believe_kamala_harris_campaign_nor_harris/,/r/YAPms/comments/1ffz7m0/i_dont_believe_kamala_harris_campaign_nor_harris/,48,2024-09-13 16:38:17,14,,False,0.6,:Discussion: Discussion,2024-09-14 12:17:38.060024

I previously made a Justin Fields rushing chart and have been working on some tweaks to hopefully improve the graphic. The main thing that I think is interesting about this graphic is the gaps....left end, left tackle etc. Right end meaning the run was to the right of the RT, right tackle meaning the gap between the RT and the RG etc. Each bar height is based on the number of rushes to that specific segment, with the standard data (attempts, yards and avg.) inside the bar. The color coding is based on EPA per play......orange is above average, blue is below average. It's a gradient scale, meaning the colors get darker the more below or above average the running is in that specific area.

Long story short: Harris ran great inside the tackles and struggled with his efficiency on the edge. I'll be really curious to see how this tracks over the course of the season.

tifu,1fgkair,TIFU by Choosing to eat at McDonalds,"As is customary this was not today, but around 10ish years ago when McDonald's was running a promotion in which, if you were lucky enough, your meal would be absolutely free upon one condition. All you had to do was tell someone, ""I love you""¬†

Now let's backtrack and I somehow end up with a job working in retail and I literally had to run through hundreds of simulations in my mind just to be able to greet a person walking through the door. With my new found confidence I was able to greet customers and assist them in finding whatever it is they needed. Through my endless simulations I was able t become one of the top sellers in the store.¬†

There were lots of commercials on TV about this McDonald's promotion, but I never paid it too much mind, reserving my mind simulations for more pressing matters. One day, I decide to go to McDonald's during my lunch break. Since I worked at a store located in a large outdoor outlet it was quite busy. I used my time waiting in line to decide if I wanted to go with the ol'reliable McChicken, McDouble, and a sweet tea combo, or if I would try a new set meal that was just released.¬†

The cashier was a lovely lady and when I got to the register I went with ol'reliable. When I went to pay she drops an absolute bomb on me. She tells me about their current promotion and says I'll get a free meal if I just say I love you to someone. My brain instantly kicks into overdrive. There are people waiting behind me but I need to run through my simulations. 

Will I be a normal person and just call my Mom or Dad? No, that seems too Plain toast. Also, because of a relatively recent situation, I'd rather not tell either of them that I loved them at that moment. 

I then think of my brother, but he works a night shift and I don't know if he would be awake. I wouldn't want to bother him. 

What if I used this as an opportunity to tell my crush I love them. What am I an idiot? Think of how that could potentially destroy my whole life. 

There are people waiting in line, think faster. If time is an issue then I'll just tell the cashier I love her.¬†

What and involve a completely innocent person in this embarrassing situation? I think not.¬†Time keeps turning and the gears in my head just keep slipping. Nothing seems to be getting done. 

I scan the room in a panic thinking I can just tell some person I love you. Nope, not happening. I reach into my pocket pulling out my phone. I unlock my phone, my hands shaking. I scroll up and down my contacts list consisting of basically no one. Things are looking bleak, I'm hoping for a missile to come crashing down to erase my existence from the earth. 

It feels as if an eternity is passing and I can feel that the cashier is starting to suspect that something isn't right.¬†

Oh geez is it getting hot in here? My brain decides to shut off and I must have been as red as a tomato when the cashier finally offers me some solace and tells me everything is fine and I can just go sit down and I don't have to tell anyone I love them.¬†

Thus ends the creation of a core memory that decides to haunt me whenever I start to feel comfortable with who I have become.¬†

TL;DR
Decided to eat at McDonald's and nearly died from embarrassment after ""winning"" a free meal.¬†",Ragnaarock93,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fgkair/tifu_by_choosing_to_eat_at_mcdonalds/,/r/tifu/comments/1fgkair/tifu_by_choosing_to_eat_at_mcdonalds/,34,2024-09-14 11:51:37,124,,False,0.78,M,2024-09-14 12:17:39.161581

Denmark,1ffx18h,Idag s√• jeg 3 unge drenge opfinde en vidunderlig scam p√• McDonald's. ,"Det var ret fascinerende, at se s√• unge drenge regne en s√• simpel fidus ud.

Hovedbanen McDonald's har et rimelig solidt flow af kunder, og specielt turister.

Drengene scannede s√• deres app p√• samtlige maskiner, og l√∏b frem og tilbage mellem disse for, at trykke ""forts√¶t"" hver gang den var udl√∏bet. 

Dette resulterede i, at deres point i appen konstant bongede ind efter alle k√∏b. Efter den ene havde k√∏bt en menu for sine point, s√• kunne han k√∏be en sunday for sine nye akkumulerede point inden for 1 minut.

De har ikke v√¶ret mere end 8-10 √•r gamle. 
S√•dan en oplevelse og minde vil de have med sig og grine af resten af livet.
""Kan du huske den gang p√• Maccen""

F√∏lte tr√¶ng til, at dele det.

https://maps.app.goo.gl/bmrrsZnviwYDEyLBA

I drive this every day and I have been for years. Not once in my entire life have I felt the need to stop in this merge lane or been unable to merge onto Tapleys Hill.

And yet nearly every day, I get stuck behind troglodytes who seem incapable of merging from one 60 road onto another 60 road with a clear and open merge lane and a long view of the road to see exactly where you can merge.

I'm at the point where I think it's just the universe fucking with me by putting drivers with room temperature IQ in this merge lane every day.

Am I the only one who's noticed this? It's one of the easiest and cleanest merges in the city and yet it's always backed up!

PresidentialElection,1fgodbm,Kamala surprised me ,"On the September 10th debate I was honestly kind of shocked by Kamala's performance. At her rallys and speeches previous to the debate. She kind of seemed  off? A lot of her speeches contain ""poking"" at trump and his policys. Kinda saying ""Were better. Vote for me'"". I'm not trying to say she didn't explain her policys or her views on certain things. She did and she did what was expected to do. Simply explain to her supporters what she has planned and what can happen if she gets into office. Besides the point, her rallys were pretty much on par with what we expected. Back to the debate. It seems like she saved and planned everything very well for the debate. She kept her composure *with some exceptions*, stated the differences between her and Trump's policy's, She directed mostly everything she said to us the people. It's was a very solid performance for Kamala. I hope there's a second debate so we can see if shes consistent.

thebulwark,1fgghwd,Kamala needs to do more guerrilla marketing,"I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right term, but Harris needs to go on more podcasts, tv shows, YouTube channels, etc. I keep seeing Trump and Vance doing all these shows and getting their insane message out. They get attention and the clips go around the internet. 

I feel like Harris and Walz have not been particularly visible except for big events every couple of weeks (the DNC convention, the CNN interview, and the debate). Maybe I‚Äôm just not watching the right things. But it seems like they go quiet in between.

I realize these were big things to prepare for and it‚Äôs a short campaign. But now that these major things are behind them, they need to get out more and just let the public get to know them.

I keep hearing how the debate was Harris‚Äô ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù to many 
Americans. I understand she hasn‚Äôt been the candidate for too long, but I think she needs to do more than just big rallies and other big events.

Sorry for the rant, but I‚Äôm tired of listening to Trump rant and rave every day. He somehow manages to make news and get his (insane) message out.

We believe the integrity of the office of the presidency, and the future of our nation, must come before party loyalty. Kamala Harris, though not without disagreements on policy, offers a path forward that respects the rule of law and upholds the dignity of the presidency, which is paramount in these troubling times.

mormon,1fgj5up,My Mission President Passed Away,"Apologies for the personal post, but I thought some in this group might appreciate it.

I received word over Facebook last night that my mission president passed away.  He was 89 years old, and spent the past few years suffering greatly from the effects of COVID.

He was [LeRoy S. Wirthlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeRoy_S._Wirthlin), a cousin to Elder Wirthlin, and a somewhat renowned heart surgeon.  He and his family (which included an incredible 17 children) lived in Massachusetts for years before resettling in Michigan.  I've learned over the years that members of the church of a certain generation who lived in either state all knew his family.  You couldn't miss them: I think they had to drive a bus to get to church.

President Wirthlin made a few important contributions to the field of Mormon Studies.  He conducted extensive research into the boyhood surgery of Joseph Smith.  He authored [this BYU Studies article](https://byustudies.byu.edu/article/nathan-smith-1762-1828-surgical-consultant-to-joseph-smith) about Nathan Smith, who he concluded must have been one of Joseph's surgeons, as well as [this BYU Studies article](https://byustudies.byu.edu/article/joseph-smiths-boyhood-operation-an-1813-surgical-success) about Joseph's 1813 boyhood surgery.

I also remember him showing us a PowerPoint presentation on the surgery itself as part of a zone conference.  It was a bit graphic; in fact, my shins still ache a bit just thinking about it.

I served under him in the old Germany Munich / Austria mission from 2003 to 2005.  President Wirthlin was pretty stern and a bit of a disciplinarian.  Rumor had it that the old Austria mission had issues with rulebreaking (though I think most of the stories were apocryphal), and President Wirthlin came in to kick a few butts and set things straight.  He was successful, for the most part.

I had the pleasure of serving in mission leadership underneath him, and wound up privy to some of the inner workings of the mission.  President Wirthlin was a true believer, as much of a true believer as anybody I've ever met.  Our APs told me that he would wake up in the middle of the night and change things on the transfer board (which was literally a huge bulletin board with pictures of every missionary arranged into every program in the mission) on a whim.

Though he was stern and very much a true blue Mormon, he also had a heart of gold.  It wasn't easy to get to that side of him.  I discovered that the trick was taking his scripture mastery program seriously.  When I finished that program about 6 months into my mission, he really opened up to me - and our interviews transformed from stern and uncaring formal chats to real heart-to-heart talks.

There were some bad sides.  Like most other Mormon men of his generation, he was a misogynist at heart.  His wife would give really insightful and heart-felt talks at the beginning of Zone Conference ‚Äî and he would then come up and say something to contradict what she had just said.

There was one time when she gave a talk about how we could save a lot of money on food by cooking at home and saving the leftovers for a big pot of chili.  She said something about how that was a lot more cost efficient than eating at Burger King all the time.  He came up right after her, and, without missing a beat, said something like, ""Sure, but those Whoppers are mighty tasty.""

He also wasn't really big on theories about free will.  He told us once that he would give his children an ultimatum if they didn't want to go to church: you can either choose to attend or choose to be kicked out of the house.  That was his version of ""agency,"" which I think was also common among Mormon men of his generation.

That's not to say that he was a stickler for rules, of course.  He ate out on Sundays frequently as a mission president, something that I've heard was surprising to those who served in the mission home.  I remember him telling us once about a great stake conference that he had back in the old Switzerland mission in the 1950s.  He mentioned that they all went over to a big restaurant afterwards for a great meal.  That elicited a lot of surprised looks from missionaries who were fastidious in their efforts to keep the sabbath day holy!

Since leaving the church, I've had a hard time processing a lot of my missionary experiences.  I've got a pretty big archive of mission related papers and documents that I've been meaning to digitize for 20 years now.  Part of me doesn't want to touch those memories again, maybe out of fear that some of them might be embarrassing or painful.  It's kind of hard to know how to evaluate major life experiences like that when you no longer believe.

However, one thing that I know is that the respect and love that I have for my mission president has never dwindled, even after I stepped away from the faith.  As imperfect and gruff as he was, he did have a heart of gold, and wanted nothing more than to serve.

Thinking about this is a reminder to me that we need to treat each other with dignity and respect as we continue to discuss the world of Mormonism, both good and bad.  Though I'm certainly no fan of the institution and am very concerned about the impact of its policies, I still have a lot of love and respect for the people I've met over the years.  I think it's easy for us to fall into predetermined roles as we discuss - forgetting that the people we're talking with are just as human as we are.

Anyway, sorry for the personal note.  I've got a lot of mission stories that are rising to the surface.  Though I'm still having a hard time interpreting my mission in light of the direction my life has taken, I'm certainly happy that I went ‚Äî and I feel honored to have served with such a great man.",EvensenFM,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1fgj5up/my_mission_president_passed_away/,/r/mormon/comments/1fgj5up/my_mission_president_passed_away/,19,2024-09-14 10:32:30,47,,False,0.95,Personal,2024-09-14 12:17:42.075420

WhitePeopleTwitter,1ff38zg,These people think Biden and Harris were president and vice president when 9/11 happened.,"In 2001, Joe Biden was a senator; we have no record of him being moved to a secure bunker. Why would he have gone to NYC on 9/11 after the attacks, never mind that all flights across the nation were grounded?. 

In 2001, Kamala Harris worked at San Francisco City Hall and ran the Family and Children's Services Division; why would she have been in NYC on 9/11? Why as a private citizen and civilian would she have gone there? There's also no record of her dating William that year, and if she was, who cares?

Zimbabwe,1fgf43o,If you met the President ,"I recently found my self a few steps away from a very prominent , successful businessman ..and I tried to think fast to come up with something to say that might have been worth his time ,I tried to think of a quick pitch to give him ,or something to say to him that he may end up asking me to visit his actual office and probably end up having him in my contact list (cause who doesn't want a  multimillionaire  in their contact list ) but to make a short story shorter I failed to say anything couldn't come up with anything to say to him that I thought would be interesting enough cause I guess I wasn't really prepared to stumble across such a person 

So my question is assume  you met the man I'm charge himself the President (Hate him or like him we all know that man has enough power and influence to make your life 10x better ,he can definitely open so many doors for you zvekuti your Jehovah's witnesses friend will ejaculate just by thinking of them ) what would you say to him to get his attention or rather do you have a 2 minute pitch ready that could be worthy a come let's talk about this at my office

Presidents,1fgkkk7,Day 10: Ranking US Presidents on their foreign policy records. Chester A. Arthur has been eliminated. Comment which President should be eliminated next. The comment with the most upvotes will decide who goes next.,"Day 10: Ranking US Presidents on their foreign policy records. Chester A. Arthur has been eliminated. Comment which President should be eliminated next. The comment with the most upvotes will decide who goes next.

For this competition, we are ranking every President from Washington to Obama on the basis of their foreign policy records in office. Wartime leadership (so far as the Civil War is concerned, America‚Äôs interactions with Europe and other recognised nations in relation to the war can be judged. If the interaction is only between the Union and the rebelling Confederates, then that‚Äôs off-limits), trade policies and the acquisition of land (admission of states in the Union was covered in the domestic contest) can also be discussed and judged, by extension. 

Similar to what we did [last contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/s/WwMHLmk78A), discussions relating to domestic policy records are verboten and not taken into consideration. And of course we will also not take into consideration their post-Presidential records, and only their pre-Presidency records if it has a direct impact on their foreign policy record in office.

Furthermore, any comment that is edited to change your nominated President for elimination for that round will be disqualified from consideration. Once you make a selection for elimination, you stick with it for the duration even if you indicate you change your mind in your comment thread. You may always change to backing the elimination of a different President for the next round.

breastcancer,1fg5jly,"Post Diagnoses, President Treatment fatigue?","I was diagnoses ILC--+ & Lymph node positive last Friday. This week I saw the surgeon and got a plan of what all is coming up. Next week I see the oncologist, radiologist, clip placement (none were put in during my biopsy), am having my hair cut into a pixie cut. Then in the next few weeks I have a CT Scan and Bone Scan.

I feel like I should be using this time to be productive and get things done before chemo starts. (I'm doing chemo before surgery.) It reminds me of the ""You think your tired now? Just wait!"" Comments I would get while pregnant. 

I am exhausted physically and mentally. I'm having a hard time being productive doing anything. I'm a stay at home mom of 4 school aged kids (8-13) and have been giving them more down time as well.

Is this normal?  Appreciate either a answer. Maybe I need a empathetic kick in the butt to get up and get going. Or maybe it's okay.

I have no much unknown right now. I don't handle not having a plan well. I'm not sure if chemo will need to wait until after I have all my scans done?

woodworkingtools,1ffzgsc,Acme Tools President Passes Away,"Daniel Kuhlman, the President of Acme Tools, passed away today. 

It is a sad moment when anyone passes away, but Mr. Kuhlman was one of the good guys who tried to do the right thing, which wasn‚Äôt always the best for Acme. I remember having the opportunity to speak to him when my brother passed away suddenly. He was a cabinet and furniture maker and ordered a lot of expensive tools to upgrade the shop before he passed away. All of them were unboxed, he didn't have a chance to unbox and install them in his workshop because he was so busy. They were well past their return date but again unused. I didn‚Äôt want to try to sell them on a Facebook marketplace, so I called Acme, where he had purchased them, and asked if they would take them back. The woman was very friendly, said she did not have the authority to approve such a significant return so far past the return date, and asked me to hold on the line for a moment. After about three minutes, Mr. Kuhlman picked up the line, and I explained the situation. The first thing he did was offer his condolences, and then he said there was no problem; as long as they were unboxed, he would make an exception to the policy. He told me how to set up the return with the Customer Service person I spoke to and again wished me well. I palletized everything and sent it back as instructed. About seven days later, Acme mailed the check for the returns. There was a short handwritten note from Mr. Kuhlman in it. Thanking me for my honesty about the tools' condition; he was happy to take them back. He was a true gentleman and a good businessman. 

I now buy all my tools from Acme regardless of the big box deals that could save me money because of one man‚Äôs compassion.

May he rest in peace.

Crushes,1ffkkxq,I'm vice president of a club and I have a crush on the president,"This is so annoying ugh. I'm gonna use my throwaway account. I (20F) am vice president of a literature club at my school and have a crush on the president (22M). I have no idea if he likes me back, however we've been bonding over our favorite music recently and have become closer friends, which is great. He's been reaching out more just as a friend rather than for club business as well. I think he is a really good guy, and he's been nothing but supportive of me and my endeavors in and out of the club. 

I have to admit, I really like this guy. However I'm worried that it could make him uncomfortable if I ever said anything because, again, I have no clue if he feels the same. He is the first person in a while though who has been giving signals that make me think its a possibility. 

We do work really well together and he is a good communicator (I like to think I am too). I'm just worried that if things did work out, it could complicate things since we run the club together. I also am a girl and am worried that if anyone in the club found out, they would view me as someone who ""slept her way to the top"" or just as ""(insert President's name)'s girlfriend"" instead of vice president. I want to be respected, especially as I'm set to become president of said club next year, but I really also want to be with him.

Eritrea,1fgns6d,President Isaias Afwerki meets Egyptian Foreign Minister in Asmara today,"‚ÄúPresident Isaias Afwerki met, in the early afternoon hours today at Denden Guest House, Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdelatty.

In the extensive meeting - which is part and parcel of the periodic Consultative Forums that both countries hold in Asmara and Cairo respectively - the two sides discussed in greater depth, bilateral matters and regional issues of mutual importance; especially current developments in the Sudan, the Federal Republic of Somalia, as well as, the security of the Red Sea.

The two sides underlined that enhancement of the bilateral ties between Eritrea and Egypt constitutes one of the key pillars of regional peace and stability. In this respect, both sides agreed to further upgrade the prevailing bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the economic, political, trade, agricultural, energy and health sectors.

The two sides categorically noted that Egypt does not espouse an agenda of regional destabilization and interference. Misconstruing these facts to peddle unwarranted statements and accusations by some quarters is thus hollow and merely invoked to rationalize their strategic mistakes.

Speaking to national media outlets, Dr. Badr Abdelatty remarked that President Isaias has a deep and profound knowledge of the history and development of the region, and that the meeting was particularly helpful and constructive given the current sensitive times.

The meeting was attended by Mr. Osman Saleh, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea, and on the Egyptian side by Mr. Abbas Kamel, head of Egypt‚Äôs General Intelligence Service, and Mr. Mohamed Hatem el-Atawy, Ambassador of Egypt in Eritrea.‚Äù",stenmored,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eritrea/comments/1fgns6d/president_isaias_afwerki_meets_egyptian_foreign/,/r/Eritrea/comments/1fgns6d/president_isaias_afwerki_meets_egyptian_foreign/,4,2024-09-14 14:49:31,4,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:17:42.075420

Here at **VoteDoge**, we like to do things differently. 

Whatever your viewpoints are, I'm sure you have noticed that the political climate has been heating up, especially the last few years. 

Presidential candidates calling each other fascists, bigots and threats to democracy. 

Here a **VoteDoge**, we don't play that way. 

VoteDoge is all about creating an inclusive atmosphere, where right-wingers, left-wingers and centre oriented people (and dogs of course) can discuss, chat and just have a jolly good time. 

We laugh together, share dope memes, talk about current affairs, all while maintaining a good mood and discourse. 

We had a great debate watch-along where a lot of people chimed in. 

Looking at Trump's latest comments, there's a big chance another debate might be on the horizon soon.

santarosa,1fg2cv9,Vote on J,"Ok so I'll begin by stating I'm not political in any way, but I'd love to be educated and hear some discussion on this topic.

I've been noticing a lot of ""VOTE NO ON J"" posters, although that tells me close to nothing. ""Save the farms"" is what some are stating. But driving off the ramp in RP I saw the sign sponsored by Clover which set something off in me. There's big money involved in this, I can tell. 

The little information I gathered from the opposing argument is about animal cruelty. ""VOTE YES ON J"" seems to preach saving the animals, and their website has images of the poor living conditions of the animals of local farms.

So again, super glimpse here, but is NO = Save farms from losing money. YES = Save animals from cruelty?

anhedonia,1fgi6ij,Another vote for ADHD,"Not sure if anyone will remember me here but I used to be somewhat active in this community until I found relief from anhedonia through TEAM-CBT (feeling Great book by David Burns) which I made a few posts about. Since then the anhedonia never really returned, or at least if it ever started to, I had techniques to help me identify the route cause and deal with it. About a year ago I caught covid three times in rapid succession, despite being vaccinated with all follow up boosters. My recovery was taking much longer than expected and eventually I was diagnosed with long covid. The main symptoms I experienced as part of the long vmcovid were unprompted heart palpitations, massively extended recovery periods from exercise, and brain fog. The palpitations disappeared first, with the recovery periods becoming shorter after a few months. However, the brain fog has remained fairly constant and now a year later my long and short term memory are noticeably impaired.

What TEAM-CBT has allowed me to do is not let these facts about my life upset me, but what I've been introgued to discover is that the 'brain fog' I've been experiencing is quite likely an exacerbation of underlying ADHD symptoms that had previously gone undiagnosed. One of the first pieces of insight I had into my anhedonia was that my experience was the polar opposite of what an ex-meth addict described it to be like to be on crystal meth (the video appears to have been removed but the guy was called CG kid and he may give a similar description elsewhere). This would make sense given the primary symptoms of anhedonia (at least in my case) are an inability to find joy and previously pleasurable activity and lack of motivation to try things. The link to ADHD here is hopefully obvious as ADHD/ADD is widely accepted to be a dopamine-deficit disorder, and the most common treatment option is the use of stimulants such as Adderall (which is basically legalised meth). I unfortunately discounted ADHD in my own case because many of the symptoms didn't line up with my experience (though many others clearly did), and I wasn't diagnosed with it by medical professionals despite giving thorough descriptions of my symptomatology. 

What I wish to convey is that anhedonia is closely linked to ADHD (though obviously neither necessitates the other), and while medical interventions for either will likely benefit the other, it is (in my opinion) possible to overcome the negative emotional aspects of either through TEAM-CBT. That being said, the predominant way in which these negative emotions are assuaged in this treatment method is through self-acceptance, and ultimately many of the things people wish they could 'cure' about themselves might remain the same. This is where using more traditional ADHD treatments might offer further benefits. Stimulants allow ADHD minds to focus more easily and become distracted less easily, this was put well by Dr. K when he said stimulants activage the brakes of the mind which allows the racing thoughts of the ADHD mind to be controlled. They also increase motivation across the spectrum.

The lack of motivation might mean that you put off doing some task that you said you would get round to (in my case this might be to put up a bathroom cabinet or something). This likely leads to feelings of inadequacy, guilt, shame, depression, and helplessness. TEAM can help work on those feelings and make the task more achievable and less daunting. But in terms of a shortcut to actually getting the job done, stimulants are likely a powerful fast track. I find the concept of caffeine as a fairly low-level stimulant option intriguing. I've long had an aversion to anything that I deem to be an 'enhancement' and gave up sources of caffeine of any kind many years ago, prior to that being somewhat of an addict. I think it's a fantastic, low barrier-of-entry option with reduced side-effects relative to the incredibly addictive over-the-counter options, and has the benefit of being tested for generations on almost all humans around the world. Not to say there are no downsides, especially for some individuals.

In terms of non-medicinal treatments, I think attention training practices like meditation likely offer great benefits too. This is something I delved quite deeply into and found was a good use of my time but have since let fall by the wayside. I found Shinzen Young's 'See, Hear, Feel' approach the most accessible, but would like to stress that it would not have been possible without the transformation brought about through reading Feeling Great. As part of my brain fog recovery plan, I also found Dual n-back training particularly helpful and think it also might have a role to play here. 

As an aside, one thing that made CBT of any kind seem unfeasible as a potential treatment for me was my inability to identify (or identify with) any thoughts or emotions, least of all ones that could cause anhedonia. I think it's entirely possible that an ADHD-inclined mind has so many thoughts going on that it's difficult to identify any one in particular. I found David Burns' stick-figure technique especially helpful on this point, and an awareness of the hidden emotion technique similarly so. Awareness of these techniques has allowed me to recognise that when I start to feel anhedonic, there are often hidden emotions that have resulted from something that's happened recently in my life. I often experience strong reluctance to explore these and the only thought I can identify at such times is something along the lines of ""I'd rather not be alive right now"". At this point the cost-benefit analysis can be helpful to remind me that I can either work on feeling better or wollow in misery for the foreseeable future.

This is a fairly low-effort post on my part so apologies if it seems disjointed or lacking direction.  Hopefully someone finds something useful in there somewhere.",Olsums,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1fgi6ij/another_vote_for_adhd/,/r/anhedonia/comments/1fgi6ij/another_vote_for_adhd/,0,2024-09-14 09:18:00,3,,False,1.0,Encouragment üí™üèæüí™üèæ,2024-09-14 12:17:43.322996

One of the most mind boggling things I've seen  is all the fuss over celebrity endorsements. People criticising celebrities for not endorsing their side, celebrating when they do, and making it a huge deal.

Why do you want fucking Taylor Swift weighing in? Who gives a fuck who Aubrey Plaza wants you to vote for? These people should be utterly irrelevant in politics, you shouldn't care what they think, and if you are stupid enough that what they say influences whether you vote and who you vote for, you shouldn't be allowed to vote.

Not only are these morons too stupid to make their own decisions, it's also undermining democracy when literally millions of votes are cast not by people choosing who they want to vote for, but smoothbrained drones voting for who they're told to vote for.

The irony in the replies is incredible. People assuming I'm a Trump supporter and a Republican (I've voted for left wing parties my entire life, and our left wing parties are much further left than your Democrats) and defending celebrity endorsements.

newhampshire,1fgnmvr,Jon Stone won the popular vote in Claremont ,How on earth did a guy that made state and national headlines for threatening the local police. Threatening to shoot people/police and do ungodly things to certain peoples family on the police force win the majority vote in Claremont? I just find it to be a disgrace for democracy and republicans in general. Republicans should not continue to put a guy in office like this.

KamalaHarris,1fga23v,Trump Divides Arizona‚Äôs Crucial Mormon Vote,"President Biden won 18 percent of Arizona‚Äôs Mormon voters in 2020, according to exit polls, a small but significant defection from a reliably Republican voting bloc that helped Mr. Biden flip the state blue by just 10,457 votes. Seeking their support for the third time, Mr. Trump appears to be dividing the state‚Äôs Mormons more than ever, according to interviews with more than a dozen Mormon voters and state political analysts ‚Äî which could give Vice President Kamala Harris an edge.

Since 2020, though, Mormons say members of their religion have grown even more skeptical of the former president, an idea supported by surveys and other data.

Allison Jones, a photographer who lives in Gilbert, east of Phoenix, said she thought a wave of Mormon women would cast their votes for Ms. Harris this November ‚Äî silently ‚Äî while their husbands would continue to support Mr. Trump.

Sherry Macnab, 47, a Mesa resident and corporate event manager, said she knew of women who had placed Post-it notes in women‚Äôs restrooms in churches, reminding them that their husbands would not know whom they voted for.

A grass-roots group called Latter-day Saints for Harris-Walz that works with the campaign held a video call in August to generate enthusiasm, and plans to begin in-person events this fall, according to Rob Taber, an organizer.

And on Thursday, about 50 people, many of them Mormon, met at a home in a neighborhood in Gilbert to listen to a campaign speech from Representative Ruben Gallego, the Democrat running for U.S. Senate against Kari Lake. Such a gathering might have been unlikely not long ago, but Republican attendees said they felt some of their party‚Äôs candidates were no longer people they could support.

Democrats may not succeed in turning an enormous number of Mormons into outright supporters of Ms. Harris, with whom they still have substantial policy differences. Even Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a prominent Mormon critic of Mr. Trump, has not said whether he voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 ‚Äî only that he did not vote for Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, he declined to tell reporters in Washington if he would back Ms. Harris. But there is a sense that a growing number may at least choose not to vote for Mr. Trump, instead selecting a third-party candidate or abstaining.",John3262005,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/trump-divides-arizonas-crucial-mormon-vote.html,/r/KamalaHarris/comments/1fga23v/trump_divides_arizonas_crucial_mormon_vote/,9,2024-09-14 00:39:53,50,,False,0.94,:snoo:  article,2024-09-14 12:17:43.322996

politics,15fpsf5,"Megathread: Trump Indicted on Third Set of Charges, This Time Related to the January 6th Attack and Associated Efforts to Overturn the 2020 Presidential Election","On Tuesday, former president and current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. [Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

azpolitics,18zspso,Future of this sub,"Hi all,

Your friendly mod here. 

This sub started nearly two years ago in response to r/arizonapolitics refusing to shut down bad actors who spread disinformation. Subsequently, that sub has turned off all commenting. Into the vacuum sprang this and r/Arizona_Politics, the latter being an echo chamber for right-wingers who think it is edgy to call Katie Hobbs a ""bitch"". Such is political discourse today. But what it means is that this seems like this the only place on Reddit that (semi)rational discourse about Arizona politics can occur. 

Over the course of this sub I (as mod) have only banned a handful of Redditors, the majority of whom got subsequently deleted by Reddit. I try to be fair as long as people keep things civil to each other. 

All of this said, I don't know how longer I can keep this up. I'm responsible for \~90% of the posts here and (while I feel it a civic duty to post about AZ politics), it takes up time. And moving forward, I don't think I've as much time to devote.

azpolitics,18bijnr,Kari Lake and Resign-to-Run,"Yeah, this is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I have been thinking about Kari Lake and her bid for a seat in the US Senate weighed against her claim that she is the true governor of Arizona.

Arizona is a resign-to-run state. Specifically an elected official must resign her or his position in order to run for another office unless it is the final year of their term. As the current governor's term ends in 2027, shouldn't Lake have had to resign her position as ""the true governor of Arizona"" in order to run for senate?

Also, let's play with a hypothetical. Suppose she somehow DID somehow prove she is indeed legally the true governor of Arizona. If she took office, her current Senate bid would compel her to immediately resign it.

Disclaiming that I think Kari Lake is an unhinged loon, I'm curious as to other Arizonan's thoughts on this conundrum.

Make sure people know who supports abortion rights and who brags about ending Roe v Wade.

Make sure they know who will defend social security and medicare and who just can't stop accidentally admitting he wants to cut them.

Make sure they know who supports a bi-partisan border reform bill that empowers the President to close the border and who ordered his cronies in Congress to kill it so he could keep campaigning on it.

moderatepolitics,137trio,Discussion on this subreddit is being suffocated,"I consider myself on the center-left of the political spectrum, at least within the Overton window in America. I believe in climate change policies, pro-LGBT, pro-abortion, workers' rights, etc.

However, one special trait of this subreddit for me has been the ability to read political discussions in which all sides are given a platform and heard fairly. This **does not** mean that all viewpoints are accepted as valid, but rather if you make a well established point and are civil about it, you get at least heard out and treated with basic respect. I've been lurking here since about 2016 and have had my mind enriched by reading viewpoints of people who are on the conservative wing of the spectrum. I may not agree with them, but hearing them out helps me grow as a person and an informed citizen. You can't find that anywhere on Reddit except for subreddits that are deliberately gate-kept by conservatives. Most general discussion subs end up veering to the far left, such as r-politics and r-politicaldiscussion. It ends up just being yet another circlejerk. This sub was different and I really appreciated that.

That has changed in the last year or so. It seems that no matter when I check the frontpage, it's always a litany of anti-conservative topics and op eds. The top comments on every thread are similarly heavily left wing, which wouldn't be so bad if conservative comments weren't buried with downvotes within minutes of being posted - even civil and constructive comments. Even when a pro-conservative thread gets posted such as the recent one about Sonia Sotomayor, 90% of the comments are complaining about either the source (""omg how could you link to the Daily Caller?"") or the content itself (""omg this is just a hit piece, we should really be focusing on Clarence Thomas!""). The result is that conservatives have left this sub *en masse*. On pretty much any thread the split between progressive and conservative users is something like 90/10.

It's hard to understand what is the difference between this sub and r-politics anymore, except that here you have to find circumferential ways to insult Republicans as opposed to direct insults. This isn't a meaningful difference and clearly the majority of users here have learned how to technically obey the rules while still pushing the same agenda being pushed elsewhere on Reddit.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy fix. You can't just moderate away people's views... if the majority here is militantly progressive then I guess that's just how it is. But it's tragic that this sub has joined the rest of them too instead of being a beacon of even-handed discussion in a sea of darkness, like it used to be.",Futhis,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/137trio/discussion_on_this_subreddit_is_being_suffocated/,/r/moderatepolitics/comments/137trio/discussion_on_this_subreddit_is_being_suffocated/,1378,2023-05-04 17:19:52,1100,,False,0.85,Meta,2024-09-14 12:17:56.109655

PresidentialElection,1aofxud,Presidential Debate Can Biden Handle The Pressure?,"I'm curious if you think in the first Presidential Debate, if Biden will be able to handle the pressure of the questions and Trump standing up there firing off remarks at him? I think he will break to be honest. With watching him the last couple of times he was on TV, Biden did not look well. I think in a debate setting, with intense questions and Trump rapid firing off comments and answers, putting Biden down and looking over at Biden and making remarks, it will just be too much! I think Biden will begin to feel the pressure and he will stumble over his words, then get frustrated and start to mix up people and events. Finally in the end, I think Biden will just lose his train of thought on national TV and Trump will be standing there still firing off comments and putting him under intense pressure, to the point where they cut off Trumps sound from his mic and cut to commercial. The American people will see this and Biden will be forced to step down and will nominate someone else. 

The Democratic party will have to convince another candidate to run against Trump as a last hope. The only person with a shot at winning would be Michelle Obama and they would put pressure on her to run. She may refuse and they would look to kamala, which they know would lose based on the poll numbers, so in a last ditch, they may go to Hillary, which she has indicated lately that she is still interested if the financial backing was there.   


What do you think? Can Biden handle the pressure Trump will surely put him through. Trump indicated recently that he does want to debate Biden, so I do not think he will back out of it. I believe the first debate will happen in September, so still a lot of things can happen before then.

Nevada is consistently overestimated by Republicans and usually votes for democrats outperforming polls.

PresidentialElection,174qprr,The 13 Keys to the White House for 2024,"The 13 keys is always such a fascinating concept. Here's the state of that so far, and what it takes for key to definitively turn true or false.

1. P**arty Mandate - the incumbent party holds more seats in the House of Representatives than in the previous midterm elections. \[In 2018, Democrats held 235 seats. In 2022, Democrats held 213 seats. This key is FALSE.\]**
2. No primary contest - If the incumbent party candidate wins at least 2/3 of the total delegate vote on the first ballot at the nominating convention. \[We do not know for sure what the delegate vote will end up being, however it is reasonable at this time to conclude that this key is TRUE\].
3. Incumbent seeking re-election - Self explanatory. \[Thus far, Joe Biden is seeking re-election and does not appear to be at risk of not being the Democrat nominee. Right now, this key is TRUE\].
4. No third party - There is no third party candidate who polls at over 10% in the national popular vote. \[Robert F. Kennedy announced an independent bid for 2024. Most polls that have included him have him at 15%-20% support. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
5. Strong short-term economy - There is no widespread perception that the economy is in recession during the election campaign. \[I'm not entirely certain when Lichtman considers the election campaign to have started. However, there is widespread perception of a poor economy right now. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
6. Strong long-term economy - Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceed mean growth during the previous two terms. \[The average growth during the previous two terms was $819.375 per year. Real GDP per capita in June 2024 must be $66,094.813 or higher to be true. Right now, this key is TRUE.\]
7. **Major policy change - Incumbent president redirects the course of government or enacts a major policy change that has broad effects on the country's commerce, welfare, or outlook. \[This key is TRUE.\]**
8. No social unrest - There is no widespread violent unrest that is either sustained or leaves critical issues unresolved by the time of the election campaign, which makes the voters worry that the fabric of the nation is coming apart. \[There is time for this to change, and it is often difficult to predict when these will begin. Right now, this key is TRUE.\]
9. No scandal - There is not bipartisan recognition of serious impropriety, as the voting public ignores allegations of wrongdoing that appear to be the product of partisan politicking. \[Joe Biden currently faces an impeachment inquiry for bribery and influence peddling. It remains to be seen if he will or will not be impeached. At this moment, there is not bipartisan recognition that he either did or likely commit these offenses, so right now this key is TRUE.\]
10. **No Foreign/military failure - No major disasters occur the are perceived to undermine the standing of the United States and erode trust in the president's leadership. \[Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan led much of the public to lose trust in his leadership. In addition, attacks on Israel by Hamas are a result of freeing $6B to Iran, who aided in planning the attack. This key is FALSE.\]**
11. Major Foreign/military success - There is an achievement that is seen as improving the prestige and interests of the United States. \[So far, Joe Biden does not have any successes in foreign policy or military. However, there is time to change this key, as it requires an achievement. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
12. **Incumbent Charisma - The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. \[This key is FALSE.\]**
13. **Uncharismatic Challenger - The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. \[This key is TRUE.\]**

Right now, there are six keys that are turned false, which would predict a Joe Biden loss. However, of the six keys that are false, three have the ability to turn true. At the same time, there are four keys that are false that could become false. Anything in bold will remain unchanged, or has a 99.9% chance of being unchanged.",ttircdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/174qprr/the_13_keys_to_the_white_house_for_2024/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/174qprr/the_13_keys_to_the_white_house_for_2024/,33,2023-10-10 17:22:06,9,,False,0.85,None,2024-09-14 12:18:00.657057

PresidentialElection,1bbejhr,Serious Respectful Biden Question," 

Hello Redditors.

I am neither team red or blue my favorite presidents have been JFK & Nixon I am in my 30's i have not truly liked any president since being alive. Although i vote for the person most suited for the job after all we pay the government almost half of our checks every payroll. Then again whenever we want to spend it on anything at all. I am mostly Team The People!

So my question is why did you vote for Biden? I get that he was the final boss of the blue army but what has the guy done personally for you after 4 years? Trump i must say handled his term pretty well we were getting out of debt stocks were up jobs were at a high. From my view the only thing Biden has done is send our tax dollars to another country while America may not be at war with another country. We are struggling to stay alive with inflation.",agentbird,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1bbejhr/serious_respectful_biden_question/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1bbejhr/serious_respectful_biden_question/,73,2024-03-10 16:36:19,9,,False,0.67,None,2024-09-14 12:18:00.657057

‚ÄúWith the sitting president running again, you‚Äôre not going to have a big internal party fight, that‚Äôs a major key, and you‚Äôre unlikely to have a big third-party movement. It's also worth noting that Biden will probably achieve major policy changes from the Trump administration,‚Äù he said.

The 13 Keys to the Presidency

1. Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the US House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections. 

False

2. Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination. 

True

3. Incumbency: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president. 

True


4. Third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign. 

True

5. Short term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. 




6. Long term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. 




7. Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy. 

Lichtman already called this true regarding energy policy     

True


8. Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term. 

True

9. Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal. 

True

10. Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. 

True

11. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs. 




12. Incumbent charisma: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. 

False


13. Challenger charisma: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. 

True

_____
There are three keys undetermined, 5,6,11. 6, long term economy will probably be true. There are only TWO false keys currently.




If ALL three pending keys turn false that leaves FIVE false keys.




Six false keys are required to defeat the incumbent President 




Since none of the opposing candidates meet criteria for charisma, it does not matter who runs against Biden




HOWEVER, IF A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE KEY IS TRIPPED, and the economy tanks and there is no foreign policy success, THEN THE CHALLENGING PARTY WILL WIN.

There could be a foreign policy failure. I marked number 10, true based on my general outlook. Time will tell.



As things are now, the incumbent will win.",Joboggi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/13p4gnp/13_keys_to_the_presidency_2024/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/13p4gnp/13_keys_to_the_presidency_2024/,21,2023-05-22 21:46:10,10,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:00.657057

PresidentialElection,176ci3w,Robert De Niro has something to say,"BREAKING: In a devastating speech, iconic actor Robert De Niro rips Donald Trump to shreds, declaring that Trump is ‚Äúnot a bad man,‚Äù but ‚Äúan evil one‚Äù who is a ‚Äúwanna be tough guy‚Äù and has ‚Äúno morals or ethics.‚Äù

But Robert De Niro didn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶

De Niro continued: 

‚ÄúTrump has no sense of right or wrong. No regard for¬†anyone¬†but himself ‚Äî not the people he was supposed to lead and protect, not the people he does business with, not the people who follow him, blindly and loyally, not even the people who consider themselves his ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù He has contempt for all of them.

The repercussions of his turbulent presidency divided America and rattled New York City beyond imagination.¬† Remember how we were jolted by crisis in early 2020, as a virus swept the world. 

We lived with Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†bombastic behavior¬†every day on the national stage, and we suffered as we saw our neighbors piling up in¬†body bags. 
The man who was supposed to protect this country put it in peril, because of his recklessness and impulsiveness. It was like an abusive father ruling the family by fear and violent behavior.¬† That was the consequence of New York‚Äôs warning getting ignored. Next time, we know it will be worse.

Make no mistake: the twice-impeached, 4-time indicted Donald Trump is still a fool. But we can‚Äôt let our fellow Americans write him off like one. Evil thrives in the shadow of dismissive mockery, which is why we must take the danger of Donald Trump very seriously.

So, today I issue another warning. 

From this place where Abraham Lincoln spoke ‚Äî right here in the beating heart of New York ‚Äî to the rest of America: 

This is our last chance.

Democracy won‚Äôt survive the return of a wannabe dictator.

And it won‚Äôt overcome evil if we are divided.

So what do we do about it?¬† We have to take today into tomorrow ‚Äì take it outside these walls. ¬† We have to reach out to the half of our country who have ignored the hazards of Trump and, for whatever reason, support elevating him back into the White House.¬† They‚Äôre not stupid, and we must not condemn them for making a stupid choice.¬† Our future doesn‚Äôt just depend on us. It depends on them.

Let‚Äôs reach out to Trump‚Äôs followers with respect.¬† Let‚Äôs not talk about ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù¬† 

‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù may be our holy grail, but to others it is just a word, a concept, and in their embrace of Trump, they‚Äôve already turned their backs on it.¬† Let‚Äôs talk about right and wrong.¬† Let‚Äôs talk about humanity.¬† Let‚Äôs talk about kindness.¬† Security for our world.¬† Safety for our families.¬† Decency.¬† Let‚Äôs welcome them back.¬† We won‚Äôt get them all, but we can get enough to end the nightmare of Trump.‚Äù

PresidentialElection,14u0nah,The 13 keys to the White House,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Keys\_to\_the\_White\_House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House)

The keys to the White House is a very interesting way of predicting presidential elections. It hasn't been wrong, per se so far. It predicted the 2000 election wrong, which I suppose most people can excuse due to the very weird election that was. But other than that, it has been right every time. 

The theory is basically that every election outcome depends on how the incumbent party does while in office. There are 13 different keys. If 6 keys or more are false, the incumbent party will lose reelection. If 5 or fewer are false, they will win.

The keys are as follow:

1. Midterm gains: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives) than after the previous [midterm elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election).
2. No primary contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.
3. Incumbent seeking re-election: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.
4. No third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.
5. Strong short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.
6. Strong long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.
7. Major policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.
8. No social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.
9. No scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.
10. No foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.
11. Major foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.
12. Charismatic incumbent: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.
13. Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.

Relating to 2024, so far Biden stands to get reelected. I personally find this model to be very interesting, due to the fact that it has yet to be wrong.

When it comes to people‚Äôs social liberties, I just want them left alone. I might not understand being non-binary and to a point being transgender, but I don‚Äôt think we should marginalized those people because we don‚Äôt understand them. 

On guns, I think we should have non invasive control measures like background checks and waiting periods. Don‚Äôt be banning any type of gun though.

Abortion wise, I think it should be illegal after fetal viability, period. I think abortion as a form of birth control is much rarer than the right says, but we should still have restrictions in place that both allow women to stay healthy but also acknowledge that we shouldn‚Äôt be performing abortions left and right because they‚Äôre so traumatizing. I also think adequate sexual education may help with this a little bit.

Then, in the early 2000s, A & E (Arts & Entertainment) started airing them. I managed to record the entire first 4 seasons all on videocassette (though I discarded those after I bought the official dvds).

A & E used to be an interesting network that showed a lot of high-quality, intriguing programming (and also a wide variety of programming). It was essentially the parent network to The Bio Channel, which was like A & E in that sense (one of its main claims-to-fame being the A & E Biography shows, which were often interesting). 

I haven't checked lately, but last I knew, the programming for both networks went straight into the crapper.

\-There's a scene where Catherine approaches Dave in his office and complains about not being used more and Dave promises to find ways to use her more (which never actually happens!) Talk about a case of ""Real Life Writes The Script""

\-""Catherine Moves On"" -- which is the only episode really devoted to her and nobody can remember what her parting words were because they weren't paying enough attention.

\-The final insult occurs in ""Bill Moves On"". Khandi's return isn't until the tail-end of the episode, she only gets a singular dialogue to speak of and even that's interrupted.

newsradio,199jvbw,Dave Foley's acting career,"This might sound silly, but I think Dave Foley has one of the most varied and interesting acting careers.

What I mean is, at the end of the day, a lot of actors and actresses end up being typecast and even for the few who aren't, their most famous role will sort of haunt them for the rest of their career. It's for that reason I could never buy Katey Segal as John Ritter's wife in 8 Simple Rules because the image of Peg Bundy never left me.

But Dave is an interesting case. In NewsRadio, he plays the straightlaced, only ""sane person in the room"", snarky but still maintaining charm boss with geek interests. In ""It's Pat"", he plays a character of undeterminable gender. In Just Shoot Me, he played a cynical blind man. In more recent times, he's played lonely, clingy characters on shows such as The Middle and Hot In Cleveland. And then, of course, there's the assortment of characters he played on Kids In The Hall, with him appearing in drag quite often. All this amongst many other roles.

I think it's just interesting because he can do so many types of characters and do them all successfully.",ASGfan,https://www.reddit.com/r/newsradio/comments/199jvbw/dave_foleys_acting_career/,/r/newsradio/comments/199jvbw/dave_foleys_acting_career/,18,2024-01-18 06:42:51,50,,False,1.0,Discussion,2024-09-14 12:18:09.832698

For instance, the first official East African mission to China ended in disaster when the entire East African delegation was executed by the Ming government. One thing that contributed to this hostility was that the East Africans bought a lot of child slaves, leading to rumors that the East Africans were kidnapping children in order to eat them.

The East Africans did not follow the same policy in West Europe because the local authorities there were not as opposed to the slave trade. In fact, much of the West European slave trade was organized by local kings in collaboration with Africans.",Zealousideal_Pace522,https://www.reddit.com/r/mediumnews101/comments/1bsmp3e/in_the_late_16th_century_east_africans_banned_the/,/r/mediumnews101/comments/1bsmp3e/in_the_late_16th_century_east_africans_banned_the/,1,2024-03-31 22:19:21,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:14.515714

Unfortunately, that suggestion just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/what-know-fake-electors-trump-indictment-2020-election-rcna98013](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/what-know-fake-electors-trump-indictment-2020-election-rcna98013)

Trump lead a conspiracy to get co-conspirators in seven states to generate fraudulent letters indicating that they were the rightful electors.  They went as far as generating the letters and sending them to the national archives.  

The poor schmucks in Pennsylvania and New Mexico that were convinced to go along with this conspiracy were at least smart enough to put qualifying statement in their certificate indicating that the certificates were only valid if it was later determined that they would be necessary.  However, the conspirators in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin weren't that smart.  

You can actually take a look for yourselves at the fraudulently generated certificates here.

These four paragraphs are particularly damning.

>There was a problem: Joe Biden had already been declared the certified winner in Pennsylvania. So a number of the Republicans on the Dec. 12 conference call, who had volunteered to serve as Trump electors if he won the state, said they were uncomfortable portraying themselves as legitimate electors, according to a federal indictment filed against Trump last week accusing him of trying to overturn the 2020 election.   
>  
>The campaign officials, led by lawyer Rudy Giuliani, told the electors they were meeting on a contingency basis only, the indictment says. After the call, campaign officials circulated language to add to the Pennsylvania elector certificates to be submitted to Washington asserting that the votes were intended to count only if Trump prevailed in litigation in the state.   
>  
>Campaign officials urged one another to keep this new language under wraps so that other states would not copy it. ‚ÄúIf it gets out we changed the language for PA it could snowball,‚Äù one campaign official wrote, according to the indictment.  
>  
>The allegation that campaign officials sought to prevent electors in other states from learning about the language used in Pennsylvania is a key new revelation in the four-count, 45-page federal indictment, which accuses Trump of a sprawling effort to ‚Äúretain power‚Äù illegally with the help of six co-conspirators.

The conspirators knew what they were doing was wrong, and they did it anyway.  And they worked to keep their seven states from communicating with eachother to prevent the other five from adding qualifying statements like PA and NM.

mopolitics,1b87uly,Utah Cacuse experience,"I tried to attend my neighborhood caucus night but it conflicted with an event at the school that my kid was participating in. I pre-registered so that I could be on top of things. I printed out my absentee ballot since I was only going to be able to drop it off, not attend in person. 

The Utah Caucus system sucks. It's broken and it appears that this is by design. With a caucus the party runs the thing so there's less accountability.

In the end, DJT won Utah by earning 1.6% of the eligible Utah vote. That fact alone bothers me, but the story out of Utah is that there were long lines, registrations that got lost, website issues, and volunteers who didn't know enough about the process to be of any help. 

When I got to the caucus place people were being sent to a different place because their neighborhood location had been changed less than 3 days ago. I walked in not knowing for sure my neighborhood ID number and they gave me a map to find my house on, but the map didn't have any roads labeled and was old enough that landmarks weren't there.

When I found out where I was supposed to go I met the wife of my former bishop who seemed to be running the thing. She's a nice lady but this is the same woman who attended church during COVID-19 defiantly maskless every week. She's aggressively political. I walked up and she recognized me and helped me out. Even with her help, there was confusion. The volunteer didn't know what to do. They took my envelope and asked my name because I said I had preregistered. They couldn't find me on the list. They handed me back the copy of my state-issued ID without even looking at it (this is the party that concerns themselves with secure elections). They ended up just promising to include my vote when the time came.

Because of the caucus nobody in my family but me participated. The scheduling was the issue. Because I couldn't attend in person I didn't get a say in my caucus chair positions or my delegates. Most of the people present were what I would call older (elderly) and one of the steps they had us do was to scan a QR code. Most people that age don't know what to do with a QR code. There's a video from one caucus meeting where there were real issues and one guy shouts ""Why do I need my phone to vote?"". Good question. 

As I said, in the end, Utah chose Trump. If we had an open primary here way more people would have participated and the winner would better represent the actual population of Utah and not just the party favorite. To paraphrase Mike Lee ‚ÄúDemocracy isn't the objective"". It appears that the GOP has even given up on a republic.

mopolitics,16x5x7q,Some Thoughts from the Recent Modding Discussion,"The recent discussion on blocking and modding stirred up some thoughts that I‚Äôd like to share here.

About a month ago I decided to leave a private forum that me and a group of friends had been running for about 20 years. One of my friends - a guy who was in my ward growing up and I‚Äôve basically known forever - became relentlessly hostile towards me and my political opinions. This was my oldest group of friends, but after a lot of thought I decided I didn‚Äôt want to be subjected to those attacks and I had to leave. 

Leaving was really hard and I‚Äôve been actively grieving about the situation for a while now.

At some point my friend started seeing me as the incarnation of everything stupid and wrong with liberals. [Like I‚Äôm that triggered liberal girl or something.](https://i.imgflip.com/2yxn3t.jpg) He stopped listening to what I was saying and spoke to me as if I were just the face of whatever liberal talking point he‚Äôd just heard on the news. I think he wanted to tell liberals how wrong they were, and I was the closest liberal he had. Even when I completely agreed with him, he ignored what I said and accused me of dishonesty.

Anyway, I think that‚Äôs a big problem with politics in general right now. Instead of discussion both sides propagate meme-like arguments with the implications that their followers should repeat those to ‚ÄúDESTROY‚Äù or ‚ÄúERADICATE‚Äù the other side. I think people on both sides - myself included - come to here looking for a fight or a way to shove the other side‚Äôs weakness and hypocrisy into their face.

This sub was created to be a safe place for people with a somewhat shared worldview to discuss what‚Äôs happening in politics. But when both sides are just firing talking points at each other it becomes a hostile place for everyone. No man‚Äôs land.

And I‚Äôm as guilty of this as anyone else here. 

I‚Äôd like to do better at this and I‚Äôd like this sub to be safer for everyone.  I may be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think any new modding policies or changes that can do that. I just want to ask people to do more listening and discussing and less attacking.

mopolitics,1bhu1qy,I had lunch with some MAGA coworkers last week,"We didn't talk much about politics and in person I tend to just sit and let others do the talking when it comes to politics, but someone did bring up the presidential election and I simply asked about the Trump legislative record vs the Biden one. 

Trump didn't do much at all in his 4 years. And just line by line, the legislation that was successfully passed by the Biden administration is substantial when compared to the Trump record. I just wanted to know if they knew that or if they had a rational for dismissing it. 

Turns out they did know about things like the CHIPs Act, the IRA, and the Gun reform legislation. They knew about almost all of it. Their rationale for dismissing it is ""We don't want the government doing anything"". 

These people vote, they're very MAGA, they're pretty intelligent, and the reason they cannot be convinced that a good president deserves another 4 years is because they don't want a good (successful) president. I knew they didn't care about morals now. I knew they didn't care about bringing people together versus someone who creates division. I even thought they might minimize or not know about the legislation. But what I didn't know is that Biden putting up bipartisan legislative achievements is actually a point AGAINST him. It's why an ""outsider"" is preferable to them. They don't want government to DO anything other than get out of the way. 

I knew this, but I didn't KNOW it. It never clicked for me. They're absolutely unreachable.

Askpolitics,1399a7u,How and why is male circumcision legal in the USA?,"Male circumcision in the USA potentially violates a multitude of human rights such as individual rights, including bodily autonomy, gender equality, equal protection under the law, freedom of religion, right to privacy, right to physical integrity. How it's it still legal despite these many aspects to consider:
-Bodily Autonomy: Bodily autonomy refers to the principle that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and what happens to them. Male circumcision, when performed on infants or young children without their consent, raises concerns about infringing upon their right to bodily autonomy. Individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies when they are capable of understanding the implications and giving informed consent.

-Equal Protection: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that all individuals are entitled to equal protection under the law. When it comes to male circumcision, there is a disparity in the application of the law. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is illegal in the United States and widely considered a violation of human rights. The argument is that if FGM is deemed illegal due to its potential harm and infringement upon bodily autonomy, male circumcision should be subject to the same scrutiny and legal standards.

-Gender Equality: The legality of male circumcision while criminalizing female genital mutilation is a gender-based double standard. This discrepancy raises questions about whether males and females should be granted equal protection from non-consensual genital alterations. Protecting girls from genital cutting without extending the same protection to boys reinforces gender inequality and perpetuates discriminatory practices.

-Freedom of Religion: Male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons, particularly within Jewish and Islamic traditions. Subjecting infants or young children to circumcision without their consent infringes upon their freedom of religion. Individuals should have the right to choose or reject religious practices and this choice should be reserved for when they are old enough to make informed decisions about their own beliefs and bodies.

-Right to Privacy: The right to privacy, although not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, has been interpreted and recognized by courts as a fundamental right. Non-consensual male circumcision can encroach upon an individual's right to privacy, as it involves a surgical procedure performed on a highly intimate and private part of the body without the person's consent.

-Right to Physical Integrity: The right to physical integrity is the principle that individuals should be free from physical harm or unwanted interventions.  Non-consensual circumcision, which involves the permanent alteration of a person's genitals, violates their right to physical integrity. Individuals should have the autonomy to decide what modifications, if any, are made to their bodies when they are capable of understanding the consequences and giving informed consent.",whenyourupyourup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/1399a7u/how_and_why_is_male_circumcision_legal_in_the_usa/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/1399a7u/how_and_why_is_male_circumcision_legal_in_the_usa/,77,2023-05-06 02:27:14,12,,False,0.77,None,2024-09-14 12:18:19.963366

Askpolitics,175x75x,The Unorganized Militia,"I recently became aware of something called the ""Unorganized Militia"" in US Law:

Title 10 of the US Code:
¬ß246. Militia: composition and classes
(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.
(b) The classes of the militia are‚Äî
(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and
(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

There are no additional laws regarding the Unorganized Militia.  However, per the Constitution...

Article 1, Section 8: [the Congress shall have Power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress...

Article 2, Section 2: The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.

It appears that there is a legal group called the Unorganized Militia consisting of all able bodied men between the age of 17 and 45, they have no State appointed officers, receive no training prescribed by Congress, but are legally required to answer to the President as their commander in chief if called into service.  This also appears to be different from Selective Service which is defined and has actual requirements.

Askpolitics,18dy1uv,Is it more feasible to ensure high quality for as many as possible or lower quality for accessibility to the masses?,"Hey, I'm writing a narrative featuring my favorite political dilemma; should the goal be to ensure the highest quality or the greatest accessiblity?

I apply this to everything, all the time. I believe that when the goal is widest access, a dip in quality has to be expected. And most people's demands for higher quality don't come with an acknowledgement of limited resources. They just *wish* for higher quality and *hope* that educated, well-trained, properly funded help just solves the problem for them. 

So when I say ""lower quality"" I don't mean bad. I just mean, not luxury, not middle class, fully paid service. So often, I advocate for solutions that works towards the greatest accessiblity possible, and it is an answer that incorporates the most ""do-it-yourselfism"", minimalism, education, and automation. And people who disagree with me usually have an air of ""that's not dignified/good enough"" to their rebuttals and a demand for ""higher quality"". Some examples,

Homelessness and Homeownership: I believe the most ""amount"" of house to give someone with limited income is just enough house that they can clean, fix, and maintain *by themselves*. (With attention paid to educating them on that, too.) So many problems I've seen in addressing homes has come from well-meaning people calculating the cost of the home, but not the cost of the concierge of services required to maintain the home, as they encourage people to buy houses that require an instant elevation to middle class thinking and lifestyle to maintain. Because from their perspective, smaller, more rugged housing is undignified. 

Food: I think everyone should cook. But I also think most people only need to know 3-5 dishes, only need a pot, a skillet and one good chef knife, and about a dozen ingredients they buy regularly. When people shake their fists to the heavens and say that it's impossible to eat healthy when melons and oranges cost so much, I point out that red bell peppers and broccoli have more Vitamin C at a lower cost. People can eat plenty of fruits without picking up exotic tropical ones: tomato, zucchini, and cucumber. There. 

Education: If all you ever have is a middle school education, you were still taught to read and how to write a 5-paragraph research essay using critical thinking questions and a bibliography. The simplicity and pervasiveness of literacy, and yet our unwillingness to educate ourselves for the next 60 years of our lives, shows me how much we use the excuse of demanding higher quality to avoid providing and using the greatest access. ""But did a college educated teacher get paid a salary to make me learn this?! Then how can I possibly learn it. By just reading this book?!"" 

So at this point, I'm willing to acknowledge the pragmatism that human behavior wants to feel good by having ""the best."" Plenty of times people ignore simple solutions because they don't feel good. 

But I can't think of that many examples in real life where the demand for the best actually led to the most ethical outcome that helped the most people. I have even walked away from a steering committee that was designing a grocery store to put in an African-American neighborhood because other people on the steering committee demanded ""the best"". They didn't want whole foods that African Americans were more likely to eat, they wanted whole foods you would find at Whole Foods. And they acknowledged that people would likely not buy these foods, but their presence would elevate the grocery store and give people a better self-esteem, and that that was just as important of a goal as the grocery store being profitable and selling its inventory. 

I've also walked away from programs for what seems like the opposite reason. When addressing why some senior citizens quietly starve in their homes, I've pointed out to my program manager that it's simply an issue of getting prepared food delivered to them. (This was before the pandemic, back when ""deliverying groceries by Internet"" was still a joke.) I wanted to make a service and my program manager felt that was too expensive and acted as if it would help the most people to expect these elderly people to come to their location. Duh, if they can't get to the grocery store, why could they get to our office building? We need to provide a service. 

So, I CAN make an argument that high-quality service can sometimes help more than lower quality rugged individualism... But the examples are few and far between. It makes more sense to pay stipends and provide training for people to care for their own families than assume and wish and hope you can get enough people to make careers out of taking care of all of our grandmothers. It makes more sense to pay for gardening seeds with food stamp cards then think that you can get high quality grocery stores in every square inch of America. But ""food desert"" research is based ONLY on measuring how many high-quality grocery stores are in a zip code. 8/10 times, I don't think demanding that the standard be high-quality is the right decision.",ProserpinaFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/18dy1uv/is_it_more_feasible_to_ensure_high_quality_for_as/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/18dy1uv/is_it_more_feasible_to_ensure_high_quality_for_as/,4,2023-12-08 22:08:09,3,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:19.963366

House Speaker Johnson keeps saying this is some great new revolutionary strategy that's much better than a regular continuing resolution, but none of the news articles I've found that cover this explain what's so great about it.  Or even what Republicans love about it, even if that is actually a bad thing for the rest of us.  They just don't explain at all.

Speaker Johnson keeps saying this is great because it avoids having Congress vote on a big new government spending package just before the holidays, when nobody has time to read it.  News articles keep repeating that claim.  But if they'd just passed one single CR that funds the whole government until some date in January or February, that would also have the same effect, no big votes just before the holidays.  So this doesn't explain why it's split into two steps.

Another thing I've read is that hard-right Republicans wanted to put the parts of government they really want to avoid shutting down - because their voter would be upset - into the first bill.  Things like the military.  Then, they force Congress to come to some deal about that before the first deadline, and then Republicans don't really care about shutting down all the other parts of government so they don't have to agree to a deal on the second deadline.  They can just let all those parts of government shut down until Democrats agree to everything they demand.

But... military ended up in the second bill, the one that goes until February 2nd.  While other parts of the government that Republicans care about and don't want to shut down, are in the first bill with the earlier deadline.  Which means they can't just ignore either deadline.

So what's going on?  Why did they do it this why?  Why do they think it's better than just one bill like in the past?",mqst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/17xn88d/why_did_republicans_split_the_continuing/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/17xn88d/why_did_republicans_split_the_continuing/,1,2023-11-17 19:42:24,3,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:19.963366
