You can read [the indictment made public on April 4th of last year for yourself at this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Donald-J.-Trump-Indictment.pdf).

millenials,1ds46yj,I want you to look up Project 2025 if you haven't heard of it already and understand what's at stake if Biden loses. And why even Republicans are voting for Biden. Because the people voting Biden and Blue do NOT want our country to become a christo-fascist state next year.,"I get you don't like him like you didn't like Hillary, a woman with flaws, which apparently is too much for folks? But even Republicans are voting for him they voted for Hillary because both Biden and Hillary have teams of people working with them that are competent and care for this democracy. And BOTH faced Trump.

If you wanna protest vote? Remember, that's how we got Trump in 2016. This time however? There will be NO MORE Elections post 2024. And if you think I'm joking, read up Project 2025. Biden Must WIN.

Or our future as Americans are finished, and we become the new nazi Germany. With Nukes.

And unlike the old Nazi Germany, OURS will have successors and a more dangerous military.

missouri,1b1bxkg,I'm a Republican. And I Cannot Vote For Trump,"&#x200B;

In the Republican caucus this week, I am not going to be able to support the candidacy of Donald Trump.

As Republicans, we believe in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.  Yet Trump attempted to subvert the Constitution by trying to get Mike Pence to nullify the will of the electors.  He additionally put pressure on state election officials to find him more votes or not certify results. 

Now, unbelievably, Trump is trying to defend his reprehensible conduct by arguing that, unless the President is found guilty in an impeachment trial, he can’t be held liable for crimes committed in office.  Think about that.  Trump actually thinks the President should be above the law.

Trump has a long history of immoral, unethical, and dishonest behavior that, if engaged in by a Democrat, Republicans would be calling for his ouster.  So why are we giving Trump a pass? 

Do we no longer believe “character matters?”  Is it now just about advancing our agenda by any means possible?  If we nominate Trump again it will show we are a party that has lost its moral compass, and is not deserving of the trust of the American people.

While politics can be important, we want to ensure this subreddit remains a space for genuinely interesting and engaging content. Unfortunately, the surge in political posts has led to more spam, less interesting submissions, and a rise in uncivil behavior.

To maintain the quality of content and the positive vibe in this community, we will no longer allow political posts until after the US election is over.

This means:

**Any political posts will be removed.**


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! Let’s keep this space full of the awesome, mind-blowing content we all love.

politics,1dsupsh,"Megathread: US Supreme Court Finds in Trump v. United States That Presidents Have Full Immunity for Constitutional Powers, the Presumption of Immunity for Official Acts, and No Immunity for Unofficial Acts","On Monday, the US Supreme Court sent the case of Trump v. United States back to a lower court in Washington, which per [AP](https://apnews.com/live/supreme-court-trump-presidential-immunity-updates#00000190-6eb5-d1c9-a1d1-7ff720090000) has the effect of ""dimming prospect of a pre-election trial"".  The majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, found that:

>Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority. And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.

GenZ,1bfto4a,You're being targeted by disinformation networks that are vastly more effective than you realize. And they're making you more hateful and depressed.,"**TL;DR:** You know that Russia and other governments try to manipulate people online.  But you almost certainly don't how just how effectively orchestrated influence networks are using social media platforms to make you -- individually-- angry, depressed, and hateful toward each other. Those networks' goal is simple: to cause Americans and other Westerners -- especially young ones -- to give up on social cohesion and to give up on learning the truth, so that Western countries lack the will to stand up to authoritarians and extremists.

And you probably don't realize how well it's working on you.

This is a long post, but I wrote it because this problem is real, and it's much scarier than you think.

**How Russian networks fuel racial and gender wars to make Americans fight one another**

In September 2018, [a video went viral](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4855614/viral-video-of-feminist-pouring-bleach-on-manspreaders-debunked-as-russian-propaganda-1.4855973) after being posted by In the Now, a social media news channel. It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.

There was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.

As an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia's online influence networks** [**reached 140 million Americans**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \-- the majority of U.S. social media users. 

***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States*** 

In 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government's first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.

Here's what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA's efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:

>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.

In 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began [establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/27047858.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.  Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter -- [but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**

In 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement, [was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist's Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.""

***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***

The brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it's not just an effort to boost the right wing; it's an effort to radicalize everybody.

Russia uses its trolling networks to **aggressively attack men.**  According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named ""**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.""**  It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.  It serves two purposes:  Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.  

MIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.

But Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.  

On January 23, 2017, just after the first Women's March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.  Per the Times:

>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.  
>  
>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**

But the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:  They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.  Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.  That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:  They drove the Women's March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization. 

**Russia doesn't need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.  It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.   

A former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):

>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.  It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**

As the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022, 

>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\[Russian disinformation\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**

**China is joining in with AI**

Last month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.  **""Spamouflage""** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.  The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.

As Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.  Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**

**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**

Russia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.  Fabrika's operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.

But how effective are these efforts?  By 2020, Facebook's [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn't just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).

**It's not just false facts**

The term ""disinformation"" undersells the problem.  Because much of Russia's social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.  Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme. 

Sometimes, through brigading and trolling.  Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that's how most people feel.  And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.  

As the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.  And it's not just low-quality bots.  Per RAND,

>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**

**What this means for you**

You are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.  It's not just disinformation; it's also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions. 

It's why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.  And a lot of those trolls are actual, ""professional"" writers whose job is to sound real. 

**So what can you do?**  To quote *WarGames*:  The only winning move is not to play.  The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**  Unless you know whom you're talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.

Here are some thoughts:

* **Don't accept facts from social media accounts you don't know.**  Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.  Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.  Or they'll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.  
* **Resist groupthink.**  A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).  People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.  When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it's easy to think the crowd is right.  But ""the crowd"" could be fake accounts, and even if they're not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.  They'll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.
* **Don't let social media warp your view of society.**  This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions* \-- you see across social media are not reliable.  If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.  It is not always right.  Sometimes, it screws up.  But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.

**Second edit:**

This post is not meant to suggest that [r/GenZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ) is uniquely or especially vulnerable, or to suggest that a lot of challenges people discuss here are not real. It's entirely the opposite: Growing loneliness, political polarization, and increasing social division along gender lines is real. The problem is that disinformation and influence networks expertly, and effectively, hijack those conversations and use those real, serious issues to poison the conversation.

mildlyinfuriating,1ap1345,I applied for a software role at FedEx and was asked to take this bizarre personality test.,"I was instructed to pick whether the character in the image represented ""me"" or ""not me"". The images were bizarre and kind of funny to look through. But the infuriating part is how blatantly prejudicial this type of thing is as a candidate pre-screen (or as any step before or aftering hiring someone).

It wasn't disclosed as a personality test prior to getting the results at the end. I received a score across the ""big 5"" personality traits at the end.

Needless to say, the results are completely inaccurate and don't represent me at all. But fear not, it did give me some completely made up areas where I apparently have ""room to grow"":
* Can be taken for granted because you complete tasks without objections
* Can tolerate mediocre work from others
* May have trouble avoiding social distractions
* Prioritize meeting deadlines over work quality
* Prone to feeling stressed

recruitinghell,1f4gzpp,Company wanted me to bring Starbucks to the interview.,"Got a call yesterday for an entry-level cold calling sales job. After a quick phone interview, they scheduled me for an in-person with the owner today.

Then it got weird.

They called back in ten minutes to confirm that owner is going to be available for the interview and to inform me I needed to bring a medium cold Starbucks coffee (no sugar) to the interview. As if that wasn't enough, they also asked about my nationality, my parents' nationality, and my age.

I was desperate enough to consider it, but thankfully got another offer this morning. So I texted them I wouldn't be coming. Their response was... well, see for yourself:

Guess I dodged a bullet. Or should I say, a Grande missile?

P.S.

GenZ,1bfto4a,You're being targeted by disinformation networks that are vastly more effective than you realize. And they're making you more hateful and depressed.,"**TL;DR:** You know that Russia and other governments try to manipulate people online.  But you almost certainly don't how just how effectively orchestrated influence networks are using social media platforms to make you -- individually-- angry, depressed, and hateful toward each other. Those networks' goal is simple: to cause Americans and other Westerners -- especially young ones -- to give up on social cohesion and to give up on learning the truth, so that Western countries lack the will to stand up to authoritarians and extremists.

And you probably don't realize how well it's working on you.

This is a long post, but I wrote it because this problem is real, and it's much scarier than you think.

**How Russian networks fuel racial and gender wars to make Americans fight one another**

In September 2018, [a video went viral](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4855614/viral-video-of-feminist-pouring-bleach-on-manspreaders-debunked-as-russian-propaganda-1.4855973) after being posted by In the Now, a social media news channel. It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.

There was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.

As an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia's online influence networks** [**reached 140 million Americans**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \-- the majority of U.S. social media users. 

***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States*** 

In 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government's first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.

Here's what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA's efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:

>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.

In 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began [establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/27047858.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.  Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter -- [but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**

In 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement, [was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist's Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.""

***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***

The brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it's not just an effort to boost the right wing; it's an effort to radicalize everybody.

Russia uses its trolling networks to **aggressively attack men.**  According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named ""**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.""**  It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.  It serves two purposes:  Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.  

MIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.

But Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.  

On January 23, 2017, just after the first Women's March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.  Per the Times:

>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.  
>  
>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**

But the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:  They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.  Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.  That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:  They drove the Women's March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization. 

**Russia doesn't need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.  It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.   

A former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):

>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.  It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**

As the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022, 

>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\[Russian disinformation\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**

**China is joining in with AI**

Last month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.  **""Spamouflage""** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.  The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.

As Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.  Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**

**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**

Russia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.  Fabrika's operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.

But how effective are these efforts?  By 2020, Facebook's [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn't just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).

**It's not just false facts**

The term ""disinformation"" undersells the problem.  Because much of Russia's social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.  Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme. 

Sometimes, through brigading and trolling.  Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that's how most people feel.  And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.  

As the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.  And it's not just low-quality bots.  Per RAND,

>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**

**What this means for you**

You are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.  It's not just disinformation; it's also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions. 

It's why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.  And a lot of those trolls are actual, ""professional"" writers whose job is to sound real. 

**So what can you do?**  To quote *WarGames*:  The only winning move is not to play.  The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**  Unless you know whom you're talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.

Here are some thoughts:

* **Don't accept facts from social media accounts you don't know.**  Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.  Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.  Or they'll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.  
* **Resist groupthink.**  A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).  People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.  When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it's easy to think the crowd is right.  But ""the crowd"" could be fake accounts, and even if they're not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.  They'll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.
* **Don't let social media warp your view of society.**  This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions* \-- you see across social media are not reliable.  If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.  It is not always right.  Sometimes, it screws up.  But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.

This post is not meant to suggest that [r/GenZ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ) is uniquely or especially vulnerable, or to suggest that a lot of challenges people discuss here are not real. It's entirely the opposite: Growing loneliness, political polarization, and increasing social division along gender lines is real.

Kamala may not be perfect, but to see many of you say that you won't vote for her is sad. This ""lesser of two evils"" mentality is exactly how Trump beat Hillary and was elected in the first place.

No one--NO ONE--comes close to Donald Trump's depravity. He is a threat to us all and our collective future. Even if you are a republican, I hope that we can all agree that Trump is not a good person and has only his interests at heart. There will be a much better republican candidate capable of leading our country during the next election. Right now, we need to do our best to come together and choose a candidate who will help bring Americans closer together, promote unity, and protect both the rule of law and our democracy or we may not have another election.

TrueOffMyChest,1d8jvlr,I just doubled someone's salary.,"I manage a team of analysts, and I got this application for an open role recently from a guy who's been working in my company's warehouse for a year. Not some kind of technical position, either - he's been slinging boxes. Still, we try to give internal candidates a little bit more of a shot, make sure they don't get lost in the pile... And it turned out that this guy's actually INCREDIBLY qualified. It's just that all his analytical roles were from his home country, and when all your work was done in [developing country not known for producing analysts] and done in [not English], it's pretty hard to get hired.

But his skills were so relevant, and my team really liked him, and he's picked up a crazy amount of useful knowledge in the past year. Our HR can get a little iffy about giving someone too much of a salary increase when they change roles internally, so I came at them pretty hard about not lowballing him, and they didn't... They did let it slip to me, though, that it'll be double what he's making now. 

I got to give him the verbal offer today, and he didn't even wait a second before accepting. He was so stoked. I think he's out celebrating right now, we may not be at peak warehouse efficiency tomorrow. 

This is the most fun I've ever had hiring someone.




Edit: Guys literally all I did was hire an objectively very well-qualified person and spend like 15 minutes tops writing various ""DO NOT LOWBALL HIM"" messages, in order to get him some money that I otherwise couldn't touch or do anything with. It is a happy story and we should all feel happy for him but this comments section...

AITAH,1cij6a9,AITAH for leaving photographic evidence of my husband cheating somewhere his parents should not have looked?,"TL;DR

My husband cheated with a man. I had pictures. His mom snooped. His parents are making his life difficult. 

I (F30) kicked my husband (28) out of my house. It was my house prior to us getting married and it remains my house now. 

I knew when I married him that he was bisexual. I was okay with it as long as he understood that we were monogamous. I said that I would never agree to an open relationship and if that was what he wanted he needed to be with someone else. 

He agreed and said that I was the person he wanted to be with and that I was more than enough to satisfy him. 

He lied. I found out he was having an affair with a man. I went through his iPad and took all the pictures for myself. Graphic. In a Mapplethorpe kind of way. When I confronted him he became physically aggressive. I was scared. He calmed down when I got Siri to call 911. He left. 

Anyway I did not want him in my house again ever. When he wanted his things I asked him to make a list and send it to me. 

I found every single thing on the list. I asked him where to send the box. He said he would pick it up. I told him that I would not let him set foot in my house and that I would call the cops if he tried. 

He said he would send friends to get his stuff. I said I would leave his box o' crap with the front desk at my work. He didn't want to make them drive into the city. 

We compromised and I agreed to give his parents a temporary code for my house. They are lovely people and I trusted them. I could see everything on my security system and I would know if he tried getting into my house. 

The deal was that they would use the code, get the box from the front entrance then close and lock the door. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Instead it went difficult difficult lemon fucked. 

I guess he didn't have everything on his list. He asked them to get something from my bedroom. Not the deal at all. 

I had my pictures of his infidelity in my room in my chest of drawers. In an envelope. So to reiterate to find these pictures his mom had to go past our agreed limit into my house. She then had to enter my bedroom, open my chest of drawers, open an envelope, and look at what was inside. 

I felt violated watching the video. Then I giggled like a little kid. It was hilarious. I see them come into the house. They use the code and open the door. His dad comes in and grabs the box. He goes back to their vehicle with the box. His mom hesitates before walking into my house and going to my room. She goes to my chest and opens the top drawer where we kept a box full of jewelry. She sees an envelope with his name on it. She looks around, I'm not sure why. Then she looks at the contents. She screams, I assume since I have my feed on video only, then she stuffs the pictures back in closes the drawer and goes running for the truck. My father in law comes to the door, locks it and leaves. 



I guess he never told his parents about his proclivities. To say that this has created a problem for him is to take it lightly. 

I get a call from him. He says I left the pictures out for his parents to find. I did not. I should have scattered them on top of the box his parents picked up but that felt cruel and unnecessary. Like I said I have always found them to be lovely people. 

I told him where the pictures were. He said that he forgot bout a ring he left off the list and he told his mom where it should be. I said I would have tossed it in the box if he told me. He said he forgot until they were on their way. 

He is upset that his parents know he is a power bottom. He is not happy at their house now and he is going to find somewhere else to stay. He said I'm an asshole for causing this problem. 

I think there are other candidates for assholehood. 

1. Him for cheating. 
2. Him for getting his parents to go against our agreement. 
3. His mom for going against our agreement.
4. His mom for snooping.
5. His parents for homophobia.",Ok_Airline_9542,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cij6a9/aitah_for_leaving_photographic_evidence_of_my/,/r/AITAH/comments/1cij6a9/aitah_for_leaving_photographic_evidence_of_my/,1913,2024-05-02 15:54:33,20910,,False,0.92,None,2024-09-14 12:16:20.273418

AskHR,1f9u4ho,[WY] The guy who started today is clearly not the guy we interviewed and no one else has noticed,"Hi all, bit of a weird one here. I helped my team interview a candidate a couple weeks ago. By “helped” I mean, I asked all the questions and engaged with the candidate while my bosses worked on their own projects and half-listened. I really liked the guy. He was outgoing and quick, knew what he was talking about to a very high level, and his experience matched. Now normally, I wouldn’t mention ethnicity or physical characteristics as it does not ever factor into my opinion of a candidate. But since it is relevant here, the guy was (I believe) Guatemalan and had a slight accent. He had black curly hair and a stubble. He was also average height.

We ran four other interviews for the position and ended up hiring the Guatemalan guy— let’s call him Josh— since he had the experience and there were no red flags in the interview (not that my bosses would have noticed if there were).

He was scheduled to start today, so after a morning meeting I swung by his new office to say hello and welcome him to the team. But when I get there all I see is some tall white guy with wavy brown hair. The name plate on the door had Josh’s first and last name, so I asked the guy if Josh was in, kind of assuming he was the IT guy helping set up. 

The guy said HE was Josh, and the kicker is he also said “It’s great to see you again” and used my name— I hadn’t yet introduced myself. He said it with what I would say is a midwestern accent. I couldn’t interrogate it too far because he was called into some onboarding thing but I was really confused. 

I ran into my boss afterwards and he said he had a nice conversation with Josh this morning and he feels reaffirmed that we made the right choice. I said “that doesn’t seem to be the guy we interviewed.” I don’t know if he thought it was a joke but my boss said “You’re a quick judge of character, but time will tell if you’re a good one” then laughed and then walked away. 

No one else seems to have noticed that it’s a completely different guy. I haven’t brought it up outright to anyone yet but want to because this is weird and seemingly fraudulent. I just don’t know how to bring this up to a superior or HR. So I guess that’s question one. Question two is has anyone in HR heard of something like this before? I would think y’all have protocols in place to ensure this doesn’t happen.

EDIT: No fucking joke, seconds after posting this I got a connection request from Josh on LinkedIn— the profile picture is the white dude but his cover photo is the Guatemalan flag. 

EDIT 2: To clarify, the interview was in person and about 4 weeks ago.",LuciusDickusMaximus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1f9u4ho/wy_the_guy_who_started_today_is_clearly_not_the/,/r/AskHR/comments/1f9u4ho/wy_the_guy_who_started_today_is_clearly_not_the/,1059,2024-09-05 18:48:32,19055,,False,0.97,None,2024-09-14 12:16:20.273418

Idaho,1e59qhh,From This Life-Long Republican to Another:,"This isn't about Republicans vs. Democrats.  This is about corruption, religious extremism (nationalism), the reputation of the United States on the global stage, and the legitimacy of the Presidential Office and democracy.  It's about upholding the Constitution, Woman's Rights, my Daughter's rights, and future Granddaughter's rights.  It's about our national security and maintaining our position as the country ""you do not f*ck with."" For me, this is about not letting a sick minded narcissist unravel the wisdom of our founding fathers so he can squander the American Empire and our economy... just like he squandered his own father's real estate empire he inherited and drove himself into bankruptcy repeatedly... then defrauded banks along the way with lies about the portfolios value, hiding his tax returns from us all and committing fraud while he slept with a porn star while his pregnant wife sat at home alone, preparing to give birth thinking she was ""the only one for him.""  Why is a piece of cr*p like Trump not good enough for your sister or your daughter... somehow good enough to be the president and trusted with your job security, your financial future, our economy, our physical security, and your rights... while he suggests injecting yourself with kitchen cleaners and ammonia as some sort of COVID medicine?? 💊   ENOUGH!!  It's not funny to put the village idiot in the Oval Office.  This is deadly serious. Nobody understands that better than US military service members.  I don't care if you don't like me... or the person standing next to you or your job or your boss or this message.  It's time to vote responsibly for everyone's future here in the USA. Or there may not be a USA.  Vote for anyone but Trump.  Find another outlet for your hate and frustration of the system... Trump is not the solution to those issues.  Not this time around.  Voting  for Trump and Future 2025 is voting for anarchy.  He wants to remove the checks and balances governing the Presidential Office our founding fathers put in place to prevent monarchs and oligarchs from suppressing the free people of the United States and killing Democracy.  Please sit down and think about that before you vote.  Life can and will get a lot worse for us all if you vote for Trump.  Remember, inflation began to rise during his term in Office, and we still don't have it under control.  High inflation leads to job losses, businesses closing, home sales plummeting, home prices falling from a lack of sales, which always proceeds large stock market declines, and soooo much more.  Please be a part of the solution, and don't make things worse.  There will be a time to vote for another Republican candidate.  2024 is NOT that election.  I am not saying this to offend anyone.  Least of all, my fellow Idahoans.  Or my fellow Americans and Patriots.  You are my countrymen.  You are my neighbors.  You are all smart enough to think for yourselves.  Trump's  Future 2025 wants to abolish the Department of Education, eliminate advanced degrees that lead to large incomes and wealth for your family.  Are you actually OK with him taking away those opportunities from you??  The plan is to keep younger generations dumb... like the children of Afghanistan  who can't go to school, so your children will not be able to question authority.   Or think for themselves and act for themselves. Vote for Anyone... just not Trump.  The USA is not Afghanistan.  We are not the Taliban.  White supremacy will not be achieved with Trump as president.  The US won't even be respected on the global stage.  Those are the facts.

According to Amy, she was contacted by an event planner on Kylie's behalf and asked to provide cakes for a Kardashian/Jenner event. She provided quotes, adjusted her schedule by declining other customers, and  created a presentation for their collaboration without receiving any upfront payment. 

However, she later received an email stating that Kylie didn't have the budget for her cakes:

She also alleged that Kylie ordered knock-off versions of her unique cakes in the past:

BoomersBeingFools,1dkjrcy,Boomer MAGAs don't understand how primaries work.,"I'm an election officer in Virginia. I can't say where. I worked this past Tuesday's primary 6/18/24. JFC, these MAGA boomers. This happened over and over. They were all mad AF too.

Me: ""Which parties primary do you want to vote in?""  
Boomers ""Why are you asking me that?""  
Me: ""You have to choose a primary to vote in so we can give you the correct ballot.""  
(Boomer gives angry and puzzled look)  
Me: ""Democratic or Republican?""  
Boomer (seriously whispering): ""Republican of course""  
Then they get their ballot and they start walking to the ballot station to fill it out.  
Boomer 2 seconds after they see the Republican ballot: ""I DON'T RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE NAMES. I'VE NEVER SEEN COMMERCIALS FOR ANY OF THESE NAMES. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO TO VOTE FOR IF I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM ON TV COMMERCIALS?!?!""

They all saw these commercials promoting MAGA candidates, but they don't actually live in that district. They literally don't know what district they live in. They were stoked to go vote for a some MAGA and were confused when they didn't see the name they saw on the TV.

Lots of boomers are so pissed they have to tell me they are a Republican. I had one guy tell me it was illegal for me to ask that. Really dude? You think I'm making this shit up as I go? You don't think I have legal training as an election officer? 

95% of them look around and whisper that they are Republican. It's freaking weird. Like why are you so afraid of having to tell someone which party you in? Is there something inherently wrong with your party that you don't want anyone to know that you are in it? Also had one guy tell me ""he was testing me, and glad I asked for ID"".

YouShouldKnow,16mxop3,YSK why your countless online job applications never land you an interview,"**not final Edit: First time making a post here, so apologies as it seems im too longwinded and there needs to be a succinct message** 

Tldr: it's because you're not copying and pasting the words used in the listing itself within your resume. It's critical you do to get past their automated screening software. Also, it should be more nuanced then literal copy/paste. There should be a reframing of your skills, just integrating the words/skills requested in the original job listing.

Or, as I've learned thanks to this discourse:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_jobs


-


Why YSK: We all know how god damn demoralizing it is to try to find a new job by searching online and applying via indeed, idealist, etc. You see your dream job listed, you know you're the exact person they want/need; you fire off your resume/cv and, of course, no reply save for the confirmation it's been received and thanks for applying! /s

It doesn't matter if you apply via indeed or on the company's direct webpage. Your application, resume, cv, or whatever is never seen by a person first. It's assessed by what's called a ""automated screening software,"" that reviews your cv/resume, compares keywords in it versus the job listing, and then determines if you're the appropriate candidate. 

Sounds neat, and definitely effective, but so wholly cutthroat and you aren't even aware of it. Not even the employer who is using the site or service to host the listing. 

I mean, I could imagine how fucking insane it'd be to just have resumes mag-dumped directly to my inbox and then manually go through them to assess individually. So, these things were created, but - when has anyone ever told you about this when you were in your first ""resume workshop! yay!"" I don't even think those people know about this software.

The simple reason your not getting callbacks is just because you aren't using the exact words that are in the job listings post. You most certainly have the skills requested, you just framed it in your own way - not the way the listing says it *verbatim.*

It's super arduous, annoying, and taxing to have to re-do your resume for every single listing you shoot out, but, that's the game being played, and you didn't even know it was being played. 

I'll never forget learning about this when I was in a slump of no call backs for dozens of jobs I applied. I had quit a position with two colleagues at the same time as we had to get the hell out of dodge that was that job, and it was bleak. No callbacks, no interests. It was terrifying. One colleague opened their own business, so they sorted themselves out well enough, but me and the other went the indeed/idealist route. 7 months with no returns and dwindling savings/odd jobs, my colleague checks in with me about my search and ultimately shares that he's gotten a 3 callbacks in a matter of weeks as a result of some website he used that provided metrics to assess how much his resume matched the listing. 

I'll never forget that conversation, that website, and the curtain pull of how all this shit works. I used that site for a bit, but once I realized that all you had to do was semi-copy/paste word usage from the job posting into my CV/resume- suddenly, I was getting equally numerous responses back and interviews.

~~We're beyond the times of ""knowing someone to get your foot in the door.""~~ **Internal referrals are still a thing, so that was a blanket statement I'd put better context on based on many valid comments.** But, this is what's keeping people that actually could perform the job from even being noticed as an applicant because of sorting software. It's so simple and so stupid, but that's why you barely ever hear back beyond some automated ""thanks for applying!""

I hope this helps someone. Boy, do i know how horribly soul-crushing and invalidating it is to apply for something you 100% know you qualify for and would do amazing at only to just be met with non-resonses. You're good at what you do, you're just up again a stupid program, not a lame HR person.

Edit: 

A lot of commentors have been awesome at providing additional perspective on what I've shared. I definitely see y'all who are knowledgeable about these systems (more so than me.)

And also - i may have overextended with the ""foot in the door"" comment. Definitely knowing/networking to get your stuff seen is definitely still viable and possibe.

Lastly, I love the discussions taking place. Thank you for keeping it classy.

**FRFR FINAL EDIT**

In this discussion, these practices are somewhat common knowledge to many commentors due to it being their area of expertise as hiring managers and many others privileged with tech-saviness.

However, in my career of working with families, youth, adolescents in my homestate in high schools, community centers, and social work. Resume prepping in lower income communities is a real struggle. There's no consistent resume teaching narrative to follow. I've seen comically/incredibly sad resumes of individuals as a result of trying to identify some type of matching skills. 

Given the number of other people who have comments that this post is getting past the looking glass of the bleak job of job hunting, it's still not common knowledge. Chatgpt is out, and many of these systems I've highlighted aren't super new. They've always been there, just never discussed, so, I'm glad to have been a bit long-winded. I've been there, **twice**, unemployed for months before i finally got something right or I was given the opportunity of the foot in the door. It's miserable and so demoralizing. Learning about it really alleviated a lot of negative self-narratives of, like, ""fuck am i really not hirable? Wth..: and that leads to a really bad headspace. 

So, good luck to you all with your searches. There's a treasure trove of amazing tips and chatgt prompts to start getting further ahead of it all!

Post-note: good greif, a few folks think im shilling the resume assessment website i previously mentioned lmao. I clearly state how I utilized it, but you can simply do it on your own once you understand it all. Referencing the actual page/service was to provide evidence, context, and proof of these systems being in play. You don't *need* that site, and there's tons of comments regarding the free use of chatgpt. Don't reduce the info of this post just because i stated one example website.",subroutinedreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/16mxop3/ysk_why_your_countless_online_job_applications/,/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/16mxop3/ysk_why_your_countless_online_job_applications/,1063,2023-09-19 17:54:40,16278,,False,0.92,Technology,2024-09-14 12:16:20.273418
politics,1al6iir,"We brought the 14th Amendment lawsuit that barred Trump from the CO ballot. Tomorrow, we defend that victory before the Supreme Court. Ask Us Anything.","Hi there - we’re Noah Bookbinder (President), Donald Sherman (Chief Counsel) and Nikhel Sus (Director of Strategic Litigation) with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a non-partisan ethics watchdog organization based in DC. Tomorrow, we will be at the Supreme Court as part of the legal team representing the voters challenging Trump's eligibility to be on the presidential primary ballot in the case Trump v. Anderson, et al. Here’s the proof: https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1754958181174763641.

Donald Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021 bar him from presidential primary ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 bars anyone from holding office if they swore an “oath . . . to support the Constitution of the United States” as a federal or state officer and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the Constitution. It was written to ensure that anyone who engages in insurrectionist activity is not eligible to join – or lead – the very government they attempted to overthrow. Trump does not need to be found guilty of an insurrection to be disqualified from holding office. 

We believe that disqualifying Trump as a presidential candidate is a matter not of partisan politics, but of Constitutional obligation. Rule of law and faith in the judicial system must be protected, and in defending the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court, we are working to defend American democracy. 

Ask us anything!

AITAH,1e0cvpr,AITAH for laughing at my sister and calling her an idiot because she wants help paying for a surrogate. ,"I have my wife's permission to put here anonymously. 

My wife was SA when she was young. Her abusive religious family forced her to have the baby that was conceived. She was so traumatized from the experience that she wanted to get her tubes tied so it would never happen again. 

Her doctor told her parents because she was still a minor. They punished her. She threatened to unalived herself if they didn't let her do it. Her loving family had her involuntarily committed. In the facility she was SA by some staff. 

To say my wife has issues with sex and pregnancy is like saying National Geographic has issues. 

She has been through a lot of counseling and we go for counseling together. We are doing okay. Our jobs have excellent benefits and when we were ready to start a family we paid for a surrogate. 

Our son is two now and my sister recently approached us for help funding her surrogate. I didn't know that my sister had fertility issues and, after discussing it with my wife, I said that we would be happy to help her out. 

My wife has a lot of research on surrogacy candidates and wanted to help my sister out. So she dug in and got involved. 

It turns out my sister is not infertile. She just doesn't want to get pregnant. 

My wife told me and I called my sister to verify. Yes she could get pregnant but she doesn't want to. She thinks it's unfair that my wife gets to keep her figure and such but that she would have to do it naturally. 

I laughed at her and called her an idiot. We are doing okay for money but we aren't rich Hollywood movie stars that pay for surrogacy because my wife wanted to stay thin. 

My mom called me afterwards to berate me for walking back our offer to help my sister. Nobody on my side of the family knows my wife's past. It isn't their business. I told her that her and my stepdad should pay for my sister's surrogate. She said they can't afford it. So I told her to tell my sister to just get her husband to get her pregnant because that was free. 

Neither of them is talking to me now.  I couldn't care less if I tried. 

My wife is on my side but she thinks I could have been more diplomatic and less graphic when describing to my mother how my sister could conceive.

sphynx,199y9rk,I rescued the tattooed cartel cat that was living in a Mexican prison,"This is my baby, Kilo. In March 2023 I saw on the news and social media that a Sphynx cat had been found living inside of a Mexican prison. This is my understanding of his story: His owner was a leader in the Los Mexicles cartel, and was in prison for murder among other charges. After a party on New Years he had escaped. When he was finally caught, they beat him to death. After which, they raided they prison and found Kilo, 7 dogs, 20 guns, 1000 rounds of ammunition, drugs, alcohol, and to top it all off - a mechanical bull. Kilo was then taken to an animal shelter in Juarez. Because of the tattoos on him they could not give him back to his previous owners family and they began broadcasting him on the news to look for a new home for him. He became a little celebrity because of his backstory and unusual markings. When I heard about him, I just knew I should at least try to adopt him. I have had Sphynx my entire life, 8 up until that point, and absolutely adore the breed. I am young, self-employed, and able to care for him fully so I just felt like it was my job to try to give him a safe home. I flew to El Paso the day after I read about him, and met with some officials in Juarez to plead my case. I explained my experience with and love for the breed and even wrote a letter to the President of Chihuahua promising to care for and love him better than anyone else could. And somehow it worked! Before I actually met him, they didn’t give me any information on his temperament, health status, or personality. I was nervous to say the least because I already had another Sphynx at home and a small dog. But apparently I just used all my luck with him because he is the sweetest, snuggliest, and friendliest cat I have EVER met. When I met him he was absolutely filthy and totally emaciated. He had eye mucus buildup from infection, skin sores, and open wounds on his legs and paws. It was devastating seeing an animal that was so innocent in that state, but after a couple vet visits and rounds of medication he is the healthiest happiest boy ever. He bonded with my other cat so well and is warming up every day to my dog. It was a match made in heaven. Apparently I beat out 10,000 other applicants which feels like a sign from above that he was supposed to be a part of my family.

Anyways - I just felt like sharing this beautiful story with people who would appreciate it :)

missouri,1b1bxkg,I'm a Republican. And I Cannot Vote For Trump,"&#x200B;

In the Republican caucus this week, I am not going to be able to support the candidacy of Donald Trump.

As Republicans, we believe in upholding the Constitution and the rule of law.  Yet Trump attempted to subvert the Constitution by trying to get Mike Pence to nullify the will of the electors.  He additionally put pressure on state election officials to find him more votes or not certify results. 

Now, unbelievably, Trump is trying to defend his reprehensible conduct by arguing that, unless the President is found guilty in an impeachment trial, he can’t be held liable for crimes committed in office.  Think about that.  Trump actually thinks the President should be above the law.

Trump has a long history of immoral, unethical, and dishonest behavior that, if engaged in by a Democrat, Republicans would be calling for his ouster.  So why are we giving Trump a pass? 

Do we no longer believe “character matters?”  Is it now just about advancing our agenda by any means possible?  If we nominate Trump again it will show we are a party that has lost its moral compass, and is not deserving of the trust of the American people.

GenZ,1bfto4a,You're being targeted by disinformation networks that are vastly more effective than you realize. And they're making you more hateful and depressed.,"**TL;DR:** You know that Russia and other governments try to manipulate people online.  But you almost certainly don't how just how effectively orchestrated influence networks are using social media platforms to make you -- individually-- angry, depressed, and hateful toward each other. Those networks' goal is simple: to cause Americans and other Westerners -- especially young ones -- to give up on social cohesion and to give up on learning the truth, so that Western countries lack the will to stand up to authoritarians and extremists.

And you probably don't realize how well it's working on you.

This is a long post, but I wrote it because this problem is real, and it's much scarier than you think.

**How Russian networks fuel racial and gender wars to make Americans fight one another**

In September 2018, [a video went viral](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.4855614/viral-video-of-feminist-pouring-bleach-on-manspreaders-debunked-as-russian-propaganda-1.4855973) after being posted by In the Now, a social media news channel. It featured a feminist activist pouring bleach on a male subway passenger for manspreading. It got instant attention, with millions of views and wide social media outrage. Reddit users wrote that it had turned them against feminism.

There was one problem: [The video was staged.](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/viral-manspreading-video-is-staged-kremlin-propaganda/) And In the Now, which publicized it, is a subsidiary of RT, formerly Russia Today, the Kremlin TV channel aimed at foreign, English-speaking audiences.

As an MIT study found in 2019, **Russia's online influence networks** [**reached 140 million Americans**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) **every month** \-- the majority of U.S. social media users. 

***Russia began using troll farms a decade ago to incite gender and racial divisions in the United States*** 

In 2013, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a confidante of Vladimir Putin, founded the Internet Research Agency (the IRA) in St. Petersburg. It was the Russian government's first coordinated facility to disrupt U.S. society and politics through social media.

Here's what Prigozhin [had to say](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html) about the IRA's efforts to disrupt the 2022 election:

>Gentlemen, we interfered, we interfere and we will interfere. Carefully, precisely, surgically and in our own way, as we know how. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once.

In 2014, the IRA and other Russian networks began [establishing fake U.S. activist groups on social media](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html). By 2015, [hundreds](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-whistle-blowing-troll-gets-her-day-in-court/27047858.html) of English-speaking young Russians worked at the IRA.  Their assignment was to use those false social-media accounts, especially on Facebook and Twitter -- [but also on Reddit, Tumblr, 9gag](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43255285), and other platforms -- **to aggressively spread conspiracy theories and mocking, ad hominem arguments** **that incite American users.**

In 2017, U.S. intelligence found that **Blacktivist**, a Facebook and Twitter group with more followers than the official Black Lives Matter movement, [was operated by Russia](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html). Blacktivist regularly attacked America as racist and urged black users to rejected major candidates. On November 2, 2016, just before the 2016 election, Blacktivist's Twitter [urged](https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html) Black Americans: ""Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote.""

***Russia plays both sides -- on gender, race, and religion***

The brilliance of the Russian influence campaign is that it convinces Americans to attack each other, worsening both misandry and misogyny, mutual racial hatred, and extreme antisemitism and Islamophobia. In short, it's not just an effort to boost the right wing; it's an effort to radicalize everybody.

Russia uses its trolling networks to **aggressively attack men.**  According to [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/), in 2019, the most popular Black-oriented Facebook page was the charmingly named ""**My Baby Daddy Aint Shit.""**  It regularly posts memes attacking Black men and government welfare workers.  It serves two purposes:  Make poor black women hate men, and goad black men into flame wars.  

MIT found that My Baby Daddy is [run by a large troll network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) in Eastern Europe likely financed by Russia.

But Russian influence networks are also also aggressively misogynistic and aggressively anti-LGBT.  

On January 23, 2017, just after the first Women's March, the New York Times found that the Internet Research Agency began [a coordinated attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) on the movement.  Per the Times:

>More than 4,000 miles away, organizations linked to the Russian government had assigned teams to the Women’s March. At desks in bland offices in St. Petersburg, using models derived from advertising and public relations, copywriters were testing out social media messages critical of the Women’s March movement, adopting the personas of fictional Americans.  
>  
>**They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded, and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners.**

But the Russian PR teams realized that one attack worked better than the rest:  They accused its co-founder, Arab American Linda Sarsour, of being an antisemite.  Over the next 18 months, at least 152 Russian accounts regularly attacked Sarsour.  That may not seem like many accounts, but it worked:  They drove the Women's March movement into disarray and eventually crippled the organization. 

**Russia doesn't need a million accounts**, or even that many likes or upvotes.  It just needs to get enough attention that actual Western users begin amplifying its content.   

A former federal prosecutor who investigated the Russian disinformation effort [summarized it like this](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html):

>**It wasn’t exclusively about Trump and Clinton anymore.  It was deeper and more sinister and more diffuse in its focus on exploiting divisions within society on any number of different levels.**

As the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) in 2022, 

>There was a routine: Arriving for a shift, **\[Russian disinformation\] workers would scan news outlets on the ideological fringes, far left and far right, mining for extreme content that they could publish and amplify on the platforms, feeding extreme views into mainstream conversations.**

**China is joining in with AI**

Last month, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/media/chinese-influence-campaign-division-elections.html) on a new disinformation campaign.  **""Spamouflage""** is an effort by China to divide Americans by combining AI with real images of the United States to exacerbate political and social tensions in the U.S.  The goal appears to be to cause Americans to lose hope, by promoting exaggerated stories with fabricated photos about homeless violence and the risk of civil war.

As Ladislav Bittman, a former Czechoslovakian secret police operative, [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/us/womens-march-russia-trump.html) about Soviet disinformation, **the strategy is not to invent something totally fake.  Rather, it is to act like an evil doctor who expertly diagnoses the patient’s vulnerabilities and exploits them, “prolongs his illness and speeds him to an early grave instead of curing him.”**

**The influence networks are vastly more effective than platforms admit**

Russia now runs its most sophisticated online influence efforts through a network called **Fabrika**.  Fabrika's operators [have bragged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) that social media platforms catch **only 1%** of their fake accounts across YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram, and other platforms.

But how effective are these efforts?  By 2020, Facebook's [most popular pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/) for Christian and Black American content were run by Eastern European troll farms tied to the Kremlin. And Russia doesn't just target angry Boomers on Facebook. Russian trolls are enormously active on Twitter. And, even, [on Reddit](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-used-reddit-and-tumblr-to-troll-the-2016-election).

**It's not just false facts**

The term ""disinformation"" undersells the problem.  Because much of Russia's social media activity is not trying to spread fake news.  Instead, **the goal is to divide and conquer** by making Western audiences depressed and extreme. 

Sometimes, through brigading and trolling.  Other times, by posting hyper-negative or extremist posts or opinions about the U.S. the West over and over, until readers assume that's how most people feel.  And sometimes, by using trolls to disrupt threads that advance Western unity.  

As the RAND think tank [explained](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html), **the Russian strategy is volume and repetition, from numerous accounts,** to overwhelm real social media users and create the appearance that everyone disagrees with, or even hates, them.  And it's not just low-quality bots.  Per RAND,

>Russian propaganda is produced in incredibly large volumes and is broadcast or otherwise distributed via a large number of channels. ... **According to a former paid Russian Internet troll, the trolls are on duty 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, and each has a daily quota of 135 posted comments of at least 200 characters.**

**What this means for you**

You are being targeted by a sophisticated PR campaign meant to make you more resentful, bitter, and depressed.  It's not just disinformation; it's also real-life human writers and advanced bot networks working hard to shift the conversation to the most negative and divisive topics and opinions. 

It's why some topics seem to go from non-issues to constant controversy and discussion, with no clear reason, across social media platforms.  And a lot of those trolls are actual, ""professional"" writers whose job is to sound real. 

**So what can you do?**  To quote *WarGames*:  The only winning move is not to play.  The reality is that **you cannot distinguish disinformation accounts from real social media users.**  Unless you know whom you're talking to, there is a genuine chance that the post, tweet, or comment you are reading is an attempt to manipulate you -- politically or emotionally.

Here are some thoughts:

* **Don't accept facts from social media accounts you don't know.**  Russian, Chinese, and other manipulation efforts are not uniform.  Some will make deranged claims, but others will tell half-truths.  Or they'll spin facts about a complicated subject, be it the war in Ukraine or loneliness in young men, to give you a warped view of reality and spread division in the West.  
* **Resist groupthink.**  A key element of manipulate networks is [volume](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/).  People are naturally inclined to believe statements that have broad support.  When a post gets 5,000 upvotes, it's easy to think the crowd is right.  But ""the crowd"" could be fake accounts, and even if they're not, the brilliance of government manipulation campaigns is that they say things people are already predisposed to think.  They'll tell conservative audiences something misleading about a Democrat, or make up a lie about Republicans that catches fire on a liberal server or subreddit.
* **Don't let social media warp your view of society.**  This is harder than it seems, but you need to accept that the facts -- and the *opinions* \-- you see across social media are not reliable.  If you want the news, do what everyone online says not to: look at serious, mainstream media.  It is not always right.  Sometimes, it screws up.  But social media narratives are heavily manipulated by networks whose *job* is to ensure you are deceived, angry, and divided.

It's entirely the opposite: Growing loneliness, political polarization, and increasing social division along gender lines is real.

[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

azpolitics,18zspso,Future of this sub,"Hi all,

Your friendly mod here. 

This sub started nearly two years ago in response to r/arizonapolitics refusing to shut down bad actors who spread disinformation. Subsequently, that sub has turned off all commenting. Into the vacuum sprang this and r/Arizona_Politics, the latter being an echo chamber for right-wingers who think it is edgy to call Katie Hobbs a ""bitch"". Such is political discourse today. But what it means is that this seems like this the only place on Reddit that (semi)rational discourse about Arizona politics can occur. 

Over the course of this sub I (as mod) have only banned a handful of Redditors, the majority of whom got subsequently deleted by Reddit. I try to be fair as long as people keep things civil to each other. 

All of this said, I don't know how longer I can keep this up. I'm responsible for \~90% of the posts here and (while I feel it a civic duty to post about AZ politics), it takes up time. And moving forward, I don't think I've as much time to devote.

azpolitics,18bijnr,Kari Lake and Resign-to-Run,"Yeah, this is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I have been thinking about Kari Lake and her bid for a seat in the US Senate weighed against her claim that she is the true governor of Arizona.

Arizona is a resign-to-run state. Specifically an elected official must resign her or his position in order to run for another office unless it is the final year of their term. As the current governor's term ends in 2027, shouldn't Lake have had to resign her position as ""the true governor of Arizona"" in order to run for senate?

Also, let's play with a hypothetical. Suppose she somehow DID somehow prove she is indeed legally the true governor of Arizona. If she took office, her current Senate bid would compel her to immediately resign it.

Disclaiming that I think Kari Lake is an unhinged loon, I'm curious as to other Arizonan's thoughts on this conundrum.

moderatepolitics,137trio,Discussion on this subreddit is being suffocated,"I consider myself on the center-left of the political spectrum, at least within the Overton window in America. I believe in climate change policies, pro-LGBT, pro-abortion, workers' rights, etc.

However, one special trait of this subreddit for me has been the ability to read political discussions in which all sides are given a platform and heard fairly. This **does not** mean that all viewpoints are accepted as valid, but rather if you make a well established point and are civil about it, you get at least heard out and treated with basic respect. I've been lurking here since about 2016 and have had my mind enriched by reading viewpoints of people who are on the conservative wing of the spectrum. I may not agree with them, but hearing them out helps me grow as a person and an informed citizen. You can't find that anywhere on Reddit except for subreddits that are deliberately gate-kept by conservatives. Most general discussion subs end up veering to the far left, such as r-politics and r-politicaldiscussion. It ends up just being yet another circlejerk. This sub was different and I really appreciated that.

That has changed in the last year or so. It seems that no matter when I check the frontpage, it's always a litany of anti-conservative topics and op eds. The top comments on every thread are similarly heavily left wing, which wouldn't be so bad if conservative comments weren't buried with downvotes within minutes of being posted - even civil and constructive comments. Even when a pro-conservative thread gets posted such as the recent one about Sonia Sotomayor, 90% of the comments are complaining about either the source (""omg how could you link to the Daily Caller?"") or the content itself (""omg this is just a hit piece, we should really be focusing on Clarence Thomas!""). The result is that conservatives have left this sub *en masse*. On pretty much any thread the split between progressive and conservative users is something like 90/10.

It's hard to understand what is the difference between this sub and r-politics anymore, except that here you have to find circumferential ways to insult Republicans as opposed to direct insults. This isn't a meaningful difference and clearly the majority of users here have learned how to technically obey the rules while still pushing the same agenda being pushed elsewhere on Reddit.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy fix. You can't just moderate away people's views... if the majority here is militantly progressive then I guess that's just how it is. But it's tragic that this sub has joined the rest of them too instead of being a beacon of even-handed discussion in a sea of darkness, like it used to be.",Futhis,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/137trio/discussion_on_this_subreddit_is_being_suffocated/,/r/moderatepolitics/comments/137trio/discussion_on_this_subreddit_is_being_suffocated/,1378,2023-05-04 17:19:52,1099,,False,0.85,Meta,2024-09-14 12:16:40.526571

PresidentialElection,1aofxud,Presidential Debate Can Biden Handle The Pressure?,"I'm curious if you think in the first Presidential Debate, if Biden will be able to handle the pressure of the questions and Trump standing up there firing off remarks at him? I think he will break to be honest. With watching him the last couple of times he was on TV, Biden did not look well. I think in a debate setting, with intense questions and Trump rapid firing off comments and answers, putting Biden down and looking over at Biden and making remarks, it will just be too much! I think Biden will begin to feel the pressure and he will stumble over his words, then get frustrated and start to mix up people and events. Finally in the end, I think Biden will just lose his train of thought on national TV and Trump will be standing there still firing off comments and putting him under intense pressure, to the point where they cut off Trumps sound from his mic and cut to commercial. The American people will see this and Biden will be forced to step down and will nominate someone else. 

The Democratic party will have to convince another candidate to run against Trump as a last hope. The only person with a shot at winning would be Michelle Obama and they would put pressure on her to run. She may refuse and they would look to kamala, which they know would lose based on the poll numbers, so in a last ditch, they may go to Hillary, which she has indicated lately that she is still interested if the financial backing was there.   


What do you think? Can Biden handle the pressure Trump will surely put him through. Trump indicated recently that he does want to debate Biden, so I do not think he will back out of it. I believe the first debate will happen in September, so still a lot of things can happen before then.

Nevada is consistently overestimated by Republicans and usually votes for democrats outperforming polls. Wisconsin just re-elected one of the least popular Republicans in the country so I am guessing they will vote red whereas Michigan and Pennsylvania had a strong showing for democrats in the midterms.

PresidentialElection,174qprr,The 13 Keys to the White House for 2024,"The 13 keys is always such a fascinating concept. Here's the state of that so far, and what it takes for key to definitively turn true or false.

1. P**arty Mandate - the incumbent party holds more seats in the House of Representatives than in the previous midterm elections. \[In 2018, Democrats held 235 seats. In 2022, Democrats held 213 seats. This key is FALSE.\]**
2. No primary contest - If the incumbent party candidate wins at least 2/3 of the total delegate vote on the first ballot at the nominating convention. \[We do not know for sure what the delegate vote will end up being, however it is reasonable at this time to conclude that this key is TRUE\].
3. Incumbent seeking re-election - Self explanatory. \[Thus far, Joe Biden is seeking re-election and does not appear to be at risk of not being the Democrat nominee. Right now, this key is TRUE\].
4. No third party - There is no third party candidate who polls at over 10% in the national popular vote. \[Robert F. Kennedy announced an independent bid for 2024. Most polls that have included him have him at 15%-20% support. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
5. Strong short-term economy - There is no widespread perception that the economy is in recession during the election campaign. \[I'm not entirely certain when Lichtman considers the election campaign to have started. However, there is widespread perception of a poor economy right now. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
6. Strong long-term economy - Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceed mean growth during the previous two terms. \[The average growth during the previous two terms was $819.375 per year. Real GDP per capita in June 2024 must be $66,094.813 or higher to be true. Right now, this key is TRUE.\]
7. **Major policy change - Incumbent president redirects the course of government or enacts a major policy change that has broad effects on the country's commerce, welfare, or outlook. \[This key is TRUE.\]**
8. No social unrest - There is no widespread violent unrest that is either sustained or leaves critical issues unresolved by the time of the election campaign, which makes the voters worry that the fabric of the nation is coming apart. \[There is time for this to change, and it is often difficult to predict when these will begin. Right now, this key is TRUE.\]
9. No scandal - There is not bipartisan recognition of serious impropriety, as the voting public ignores allegations of wrongdoing that appear to be the product of partisan politicking. \[Joe Biden currently faces an impeachment inquiry for bribery and influence peddling. It remains to be seen if he will or will not be impeached. At this moment, there is not bipartisan recognition that he either did or likely commit these offenses, so right now this key is TRUE.\]
10. **No Foreign/military failure - No major disasters occur the are perceived to undermine the standing of the United States and erode trust in the president's leadership. \[Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan led much of the public to lose trust in his leadership. In addition, attacks on Israel by Hamas are a result of freeing $6B to Iran, who aided in planning the attack. This key is FALSE.\]**
11. Major Foreign/military success - There is an achievement that is seen as improving the prestige and interests of the United States. \[So far, Joe Biden does not have any successes in foreign policy or military. However, there is time to change this key, as it requires an achievement. Right now, this key is FALSE.\]
12. **Incumbent Charisma - The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. \[This key is FALSE.\]**
13. **Uncharismatic Challenger - The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. \[This key is TRUE.\]**

Right now, there are six keys that are turned false, which would predict a Joe Biden loss. However, of the six keys that are false, three have the ability to turn true. At the same time, there are four keys that are false that could become false. Anything in bold will remain unchanged, or has a 99.9% chance of being unchanged.",ttircdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/174qprr/the_13_keys_to_the_white_house_for_2024/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/174qprr/the_13_keys_to_the_white_house_for_2024/,33,2023-10-10 17:22:06,9,,False,0.85,None,2024-09-14 12:16:46.177308

PresidentialElection,1bbejhr,Serious Respectful Biden Question," 

Hello Redditors.

I am neither team red or blue my favorite presidents have been JFK & Nixon I am in my 30's i have not truly liked any president since being alive. Although i vote for the person most suited for the job after all we pay the government almost half of our checks every payroll. Then again whenever we want to spend it on anything at all. I am mostly Team The People!

So my question is why did you vote for Biden? I get that he was the final boss of the blue army but what has the guy done personally for you after 4 years? Trump i must say handled his term pretty well we were getting out of debt stocks were up jobs were at a high. From my view the only thing Biden has done is send our tax dollars to another country while America may not be at war with another country. We are struggling to stay alive with inflation.",agentbird,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1bbejhr/serious_respectful_biden_question/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1bbejhr/serious_respectful_biden_question/,73,2024-03-10 16:36:19,9,,False,0.68,None,2024-09-14 12:16:46.177308

Six false keys are required to defeat the incumbent President.

https://www.american.edu/cas/news/13-keys-to-the-white-house.cfm

https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/the-americas/what-is-allan-lichtman-s-prediction-for-the-2024-us-presidential-election-1.1109868

“With the sitting president running again, you’re not going to have a big internal party fight, that’s a major key, and you’re unlikely to have a big third-party movement. It's also worth noting that Biden will probably achieve major policy changes from the Trump administration,” he said.

The 13 Keys to the Presidency

1. Party mandate: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the US House of Representatives than after the previous midterm elections. 

False

2. Contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination. 

True

3. Incumbency: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president. 

True


4. Third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign. 

True

5. Short term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign. 




6. Long term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms. 




7. Policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy. 

Lichtman already called this true regarding energy policy     

True


8. Social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term. 

True

9. Scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal. 

True

10. Foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs. 

True

11. Foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs. 




12. Incumbent charisma: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero. 

False


13. Challenger charisma: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero. 

True

_____
There are three keys undetermined, 5,6,11. 6, long term economy will probably be true. There are only TWO false keys currently.




If ALL three pending keys turn false that leaves FIVE false keys.




Six false keys are required to defeat the incumbent President 




Since none of the opposing candidates meet criteria for charisma, it does not matter who runs against Biden




HOWEVER, IF A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE KEY IS TRIPPED, and the economy tanks and there is no foreign policy success, THEN THE CHALLENGING PARTY WILL WIN.

There could be a foreign policy failure. I marked number 10, true based on my general outlook. Time will tell.

PresidentialElection,176ci3w,Robert De Niro has something to say,"BREAKING: In a devastating speech, iconic actor Robert De Niro rips Donald Trump to shreds, declaring that Trump is “not a bad man,” but “an evil one” who is a “wanna be tough guy” and has “no morals or ethics.”

But Robert De Niro didn’t stop there…

De Niro continued: 

“Trump has no sense of right or wrong. No regard for anyone but himself — not the people he was supposed to lead and protect, not the people he does business with, not the people who follow him, blindly and loyally, not even the people who consider themselves his “friends.” He has contempt for all of them.

The repercussions of his turbulent presidency divided America and rattled New York City beyond imagination.  Remember how we were jolted by crisis in early 2020, as a virus swept the world. 

We lived with Donald Trump’s bombastic behavior every day on the national stage, and we suffered as we saw our neighbors piling up in body bags. 
The man who was supposed to protect this country put it in peril, because of his recklessness and impulsiveness. It was like an abusive father ruling the family by fear and violent behavior.  That was the consequence of New York’s warning getting ignored. Next time, we know it will be worse.

Make no mistake: the twice-impeached, 4-time indicted Donald Trump is still a fool. But we can’t let our fellow Americans write him off like one. Evil thrives in the shadow of dismissive mockery, which is why we must take the danger of Donald Trump very seriously.

So, today I issue another warning. 

From this place where Abraham Lincoln spoke — right here in the beating heart of New York — to the rest of America: 

This is our last chance.

Democracy won’t survive the return of a wannabe dictator.

And it won’t overcome evil if we are divided.

So what do we do about it?  We have to take today into tomorrow – take it outside these walls.   We have to reach out to the half of our country who have ignored the hazards of Trump and, for whatever reason, support elevating him back into the White House.  They’re not stupid, and we must not condemn them for making a stupid choice.  Our future doesn’t just depend on us. It depends on them.

Let’s reach out to Trump’s followers with respect.  Let’s not talk about “democracy.”  

“Democracy” may be our holy grail, but to others it is just a word, a concept, and in their embrace of Trump, they’ve already turned their backs on it.  Let’s talk about right and wrong.  Let’s talk about humanity.  Let’s talk about kindness.  Security for our world.  Safety for our families.  Decency.  Let’s welcome them back.  We won’t get them all, but we can get enough to end the nightmare of Trump.”

Well said, Robert De Niro!",WonkieWonkie,https://x.com/occupydemocrats/status/1712285749020926061?s=61,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/176ci3w/robert_de_niro_has_something_to_say/,3,2023-10-12 17:29:44,6,,False,0.88,None,2024-09-14 12:16:46.177308

The keys to the White House is a very interesting way of predicting presidential elections. It hasn't been wrong, per se so far. It predicted the 2000 election wrong, which I suppose most people can excuse due to the very weird election that was. But other than that, it has been right every time. 

The theory is basically that every election outcome depends on how the incumbent party does while in office. There are 13 different keys. If 6 keys or more are false, the incumbent party will lose reelection. If 5 or fewer are false, they will win.

The keys are as follow:

1. Midterm gains: After the midterm elections, the incumbent party holds more seats in the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives) than after the previous [midterm elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election).
2. No primary contest: There is no serious contest for the incumbent party nomination.
3. Incumbent seeking re-election: The incumbent party candidate is the sitting president.
4. No third party: There is no significant third party or independent campaign.
5. Strong short-term economy: The economy is not in recession during the election campaign.
6. Strong long-term economy: Real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms.
7. Major policy change: The incumbent administration effects major changes in national policy.
8. No social unrest: There is no sustained social unrest during the term.
9. No scandal: The incumbent administration is untainted by major scandal.
10. No foreign/military failure: The incumbent administration suffers no major failure in foreign or military affairs.
11. Major foreign/military success: The incumbent administration achieves a major success in foreign or military affairs.
12. Charismatic incumbent: The incumbent party candidate is charismatic or a national hero.
13. Uncharismatic challenger: The challenging party candidate is not charismatic or a national hero.

When it comes to people’s social liberties, I just want them left alone. I might not understand being non-binary and to a point being transgender, but I don’t think we should marginalized those people because we don’t understand them. 

On guns, I think we should have non invasive control measures like background checks and waiting periods. Don’t be banning any type of gun though.

Abortion wise, I think it should be illegal after fetal viability, period. I think abortion as a form of birth control is much rarer than the right says, but we should still have restrictions in place that both allow women to stay healthy but also acknowledge that we shouldn’t be performing abortions left and right because they’re so traumatizing. I also think adequate sexual education may help with this a little bit.

InternationalNews,1balg2i,"Israeli rabbi says ‘kill everyone in Gaza, including babies’","During a conference on 8 March, Mali said that “according to the halachic principle (a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning in Judaism), all residents of Gaza must be killed.” 

When asked during the conference if babies should be killed as well, he said: “The same thing. You can't be clever with the Torah. Today he's a baby, tomorrow he's a fighter. There are no questions here. Today's terrorists were previously 8-year-old children.”

“Those who create the terrorists” should also be killed, he said in reference to women in Gaza.

The Rabbi went on to explain that Israel’s war on Gaza is a “Mitzvah war,” which is defined as a war of “commandment” in Jewish tradition. According to Jewish law, this kind of war does not require permission from a “Sanhedrin,” also known as a council or assembly, such as the war against Amalek – previously declared in a biblical reference by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the war on Gaza.",e_shamis,https://thecradle.co/articles-id/23810,/r/InternationalNews/comments/1balg2i/israeli_rabbi_says_kill_everyone_in_gaza/,342,2024-03-09 16:21:32,2096,,False,0.86,:region_white_isrpal:Palestine/Israel ,2024-09-14 12:16:53.557741

Then, in the early 2000s, A & E (Arts & Entertainment) started airing them. I managed to record the entire first 4 seasons all on videocassette (though I discarded those after I bought the official dvds).

A & E used to be an interesting network that showed a lot of high-quality, intriguing programming (and also a wide variety of programming). It was essentially the parent network to The Bio Channel, which was like A & E in that sense (one of its main claims-to-fame being the A & E Biography shows, which were often interesting). 

I haven't checked lately, but last I knew, the programming for both networks went straight into the crapper.

newsradio,199jvbw,Dave Foley's acting career,"This might sound silly, but I think Dave Foley has one of the most varied and interesting acting careers.

What I mean is, at the end of the day, a lot of actors and actresses end up being typecast and even for the few who aren't, their most famous role will sort of haunt them for the rest of their career. It's for that reason I could never buy Katey Segal as John Ritter's wife in 8 Simple Rules because the image of Peg Bundy never left me.

But Dave is an interesting case. In NewsRadio, he plays the straightlaced, only ""sane person in the room"", snarky but still maintaining charm boss with geek interests. In ""It's Pat"", he plays a character of undeterminable gender. In Just Shoot Me, he played a cynical blind man. In more recent times, he's played lonely, clingy characters on shows such as The Middle and Hot In Cleveland. And then, of course, there's the assortment of characters he played on Kids In The Hall, with him appearing in drag quite often. All this amongst many other roles.

I think it's just interesting because he can do so many types of characters and do them all successfully.",ASGfan,https://www.reddit.com/r/newsradio/comments/199jvbw/dave_foleys_acting_career/,/r/newsradio/comments/199jvbw/dave_foleys_acting_career/,18,2024-01-18 06:42:51,47,,False,0.99,Discussion,2024-09-14 12:16:55.173489

newsradio,1ao40kd,"Weird thing about ""Injury""","I know this episode was intended to air in early Season 2 but didn't finally air until the tail-end of Season 3. A weird thing about the timing of it was that Matthew finally gets full medical and dental coverage at the end of the episode. However, a few episodes later, he gets fired and would presumably lose all of that.

Also, I think the first Planbee episode sort of reinforces to me the idea that Mr. James never liked Matthew that much. He has the power to reverse Andrea's decision about firing him, but he just lets it slide, no questions asked and doesn't even bother to investigate the issue. All of Andrea's decisions are reversed immediately after she's no longer there, which should send up some pretty huge red flags about what a shitty efficiency expert she is, but Mr. James offers no apology.",ASGfan,https://www.reddit.com/r/newsradio/comments/1ao40kd/weird_thing_about_injury/,/r/newsradio/comments/1ao40kd/weird_thing_about_injury/,12,2024-02-11 09:16:39,21,,False,0.89,General discussion,2024-09-14 12:16:55.173489

mediumnews101,1bsmp3e,"In the late 16th century, East Africans banned the East Asian slave trade. Why did they ban it? Why wasn't the same ""courtesy""extended to white people and European slaves?","Because they wanted to continue trading/proselytizing in China and Japan. If they had continued to trade in slaves, the Chinese and Japanese governments would have shut them out. For instance, the first official East African mission to China ended in disaster when the entire East African delegation was executed by the Ming government. One thing that contributed to this hostility was that the East Africans bought a lot of child slaves, leading to rumors that the East Africans were kidnapping children in order to eat them.

The East Africans did not follow the same policy in West Europe because the local authorities there were not as opposed to the slave trade.

mopolitics,15lahtv,What to know about the Trump 'fake electors' scheme in the 2020 election,"On another post here there was some suggestion about whether or not the fake elector plot was really that bad since the fake electors didn't actually cast fake electoral votes.  Unfortunately, that suggestion just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/what-know-fake-electors-trump-indictment-2020-election-rcna98013](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/what-know-fake-electors-trump-indictment-2020-election-rcna98013)

Trump lead a conspiracy to get co-conspirators in seven states to generate fraudulent letters indicating that they were the rightful electors.  They went as far as generating the letters and sending them to the national archives.  

The poor schmucks in Pennsylvania and New Mexico that were convinced to go along with this conspiracy were at least smart enough to put qualifying statement in their certificate indicating that the certificates were only valid if it was later determined that they would be necessary.  However, the conspirators in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin weren't that smart.  

You can actually take a look for yourselves at the fraudulently generated certificates here.

[https://www.americanoversight.org/american-oversight-obtains-seven-phony-certificates-of-pro-trump-electors](https://www.americanoversight.org/american-oversight-obtains-seven-phony-certificates-of-pro-trump-electors)

And it gets even worse.  

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/07/fake-electors-trump-indictment/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/07/fake-electors-trump-indictment/)

These four paragraphs are particularly damning.

>There was a problem: Joe Biden had already been declared the certified winner in Pennsylvania. So a number of the Republicans on the Dec. 12 conference call, who had volunteered to serve as Trump electors if he won the state, said they were uncomfortable portraying themselves as legitimate electors, according to a federal indictment filed against Trump last week accusing him of trying to overturn the 2020 election.   
>  
>The campaign officials, led by lawyer Rudy Giuliani, told the electors they were meeting on a contingency basis only, the indictment says. After the call, campaign officials circulated language to add to the Pennsylvania elector certificates to be submitted to Washington asserting that the votes were intended to count only if Trump prevailed in litigation in the state.   
>  
>Campaign officials urged one another to keep this new language under wraps so that other states would not copy it. “If it gets out we changed the language for PA it could snowball,” one campaign official wrote, according to the indictment.  
>  
>The allegation that campaign officials sought to prevent electors in other states from learning about the language used in Pennsylvania is a key new revelation in the four-count, 45-page federal indictment, which accuses Trump of a sprawling effort to “retain power” illegally with the help of six co-conspirators.

The conspirators knew what they were doing was wrong, and they did it anyway.  And they worked to keep their seven states from communicating with eachother to prevent the other five from adding qualifying statements like PA and NM.

mopolitics,1b87uly,Utah Cacuse experience,"I tried to attend my neighborhood caucus night but it conflicted with an event at the school that my kid was participating in. I pre-registered so that I could be on top of things. I printed out my absentee ballot since I was only going to be able to drop it off, not attend in person. 

The Utah Caucus system sucks. It's broken and it appears that this is by design. With a caucus the party runs the thing so there's less accountability.

In the end, DJT won Utah by earning 1.6% of the eligible Utah vote. That fact alone bothers me, but the story out of Utah is that there were long lines, registrations that got lost, website issues, and volunteers who didn't know enough about the process to be of any help. 

When I got to the caucus place people were being sent to a different place because their neighborhood location had been changed less than 3 days ago. I walked in not knowing for sure my neighborhood ID number and they gave me a map to find my house on, but the map didn't have any roads labeled and was old enough that landmarks weren't there.

When I found out where I was supposed to go I met the wife of my former bishop who seemed to be running the thing. She's a nice lady but this is the same woman who attended church during COVID-19 defiantly maskless every week. She's aggressively political. I walked up and she recognized me and helped me out. Even with her help, there was confusion. The volunteer didn't know what to do. They took my envelope and asked my name because I said I had preregistered. They couldn't find me on the list. They handed me back the copy of my state-issued ID without even looking at it (this is the party that concerns themselves with secure elections). They ended up just promising to include my vote when the time came.

Because of the caucus nobody in my family but me participated. The scheduling was the issue. Because I couldn't attend in person I didn't get a say in my caucus chair positions or my delegates. Most of the people present were what I would call older (elderly) and one of the steps they had us do was to scan a QR code. Most people that age don't know what to do with a QR code. There's a video from one caucus meeting where there were real issues and one guy shouts ""Why do I need my phone to vote?"". Good question. 

As I said, in the end, Utah chose Trump. If we had an open primary here way more people would have participated and the winner would better represent the actual population of Utah and not just the party favorite. To paraphrase Mike Lee “Democracy isn't the objective"". It appears that the GOP has even given up on a republic.

Which feels like a pretty even split between allowing everything and banning some things.

Based on these results and the previous discussion, this is what I think the policy should be:

1. Posts to news articles about the war will be welcome in this subreddit.
2. Links to tweets about the war will be removed.
3. Posts that are NSFW or overly focused on the atrocities will be removed.
4. Threads that devolve into arguments will be locked.

mopolitics,16x5x7q,Some Thoughts from the Recent Modding Discussion,"The recent discussion on blocking and modding stirred up some thoughts that I’d like to share here.

About a month ago I decided to leave a private forum that me and a group of friends had been running for about 20 years. One of my friends - a guy who was in my ward growing up and I’ve basically known forever - became relentlessly hostile towards me and my political opinions. This was my oldest group of friends, but after a lot of thought I decided I didn’t want to be subjected to those attacks and I had to leave. 

Leaving was really hard and I’ve been actively grieving about the situation for a while now.

At some point my friend started seeing me as the incarnation of everything stupid and wrong with liberals. [Like I’m that triggered liberal girl or something.](https://i.imgflip.com/2yxn3t.jpg) He stopped listening to what I was saying and spoke to me as if I were just the face of whatever liberal talking point he’d just heard on the news. I think he wanted to tell liberals how wrong they were, and I was the closest liberal he had. Even when I completely agreed with him, he ignored what I said and accused me of dishonesty.

Anyway, I think that’s a big problem with politics in general right now. Instead of discussion both sides propagate meme-like arguments with the implications that their followers should repeat those to “DESTROY” or “ERADICATE” the other side. I think people on both sides - myself included - come to here looking for a fight or a way to shove the other side’s weakness and hypocrisy into their face.

This sub was created to be a safe place for people with a somewhat shared worldview to discuss what’s happening in politics. But when both sides are just firing talking points at each other it becomes a hostile place for everyone. No man’s land.

And I’m as guilty of this as anyone else here. 

I’d like to do better at this and I’d like this sub to be safer for everyone.  I may be wrong, but I don’t think any new modding policies or changes that can do that. I just want to ask people to do more listening and discussing and less attacking.

mopolitics,1bhu1qy,I had lunch with some MAGA coworkers last week,"We didn't talk much about politics and in person I tend to just sit and let others do the talking when it comes to politics, but someone did bring up the presidential election and I simply asked about the Trump legislative record vs the Biden one. 

Trump didn't do much at all in his 4 years. And just line by line, the legislation that was successfully passed by the Biden administration is substantial when compared to the Trump record. I just wanted to know if they knew that or if they had a rational for dismissing it. 

Turns out they did know about things like the CHIPs Act, the IRA, and the Gun reform legislation. They knew about almost all of it. Their rationale for dismissing it is ""We don't want the government doing anything"". 

These people vote, they're very MAGA, they're pretty intelligent, and the reason they cannot be convinced that a good president deserves another 4 years is because they don't want a good (successful) president. I knew they didn't care about morals now. I knew they didn't care about bringing people together versus someone who creates division. I even thought they might minimize or not know about the legislation. But what I didn't know is that Biden putting up bipartisan legislative achievements is actually a point AGAINST him. It's why an ""outsider"" is preferable to them. They don't want government to DO anything other than get out of the way. 

I knew this, but I didn't KNOW it. It never clicked for me. They're absolutely unreachable.

Askpolitics,1399a7u,How and why is male circumcision legal in the USA?,"Male circumcision in the USA potentially violates a multitude of human rights such as individual rights, including bodily autonomy, gender equality, equal protection under the law, freedom of religion, right to privacy, right to physical integrity. How it's it still legal despite these many aspects to consider:
-Bodily Autonomy: Bodily autonomy refers to the principle that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and what happens to them. Male circumcision, when performed on infants or young children without their consent, raises concerns about infringing upon their right to bodily autonomy. Individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies when they are capable of understanding the implications and giving informed consent.

-Equal Protection: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that all individuals are entitled to equal protection under the law. When it comes to male circumcision, there is a disparity in the application of the law. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is illegal in the United States and widely considered a violation of human rights. The argument is that if FGM is deemed illegal due to its potential harm and infringement upon bodily autonomy, male circumcision should be subject to the same scrutiny and legal standards.

-Gender Equality: The legality of male circumcision while criminalizing female genital mutilation is a gender-based double standard. This discrepancy raises questions about whether males and females should be granted equal protection from non-consensual genital alterations. Protecting girls from genital cutting without extending the same protection to boys reinforces gender inequality and perpetuates discriminatory practices.

-Freedom of Religion: Male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons, particularly within Jewish and Islamic traditions. Subjecting infants or young children to circumcision without their consent infringes upon their freedom of religion. Individuals should have the right to choose or reject religious practices and this choice should be reserved for when they are old enough to make informed decisions about their own beliefs and bodies.

-Right to Privacy: The right to privacy, although not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, has been interpreted and recognized by courts as a fundamental right. Non-consensual male circumcision can encroach upon an individual's right to privacy, as it involves a surgical procedure performed on a highly intimate and private part of the body without the person's consent.

-Right to Physical Integrity: The right to physical integrity is the principle that individuals should be free from physical harm or unwanted interventions.  Non-consensual circumcision, which involves the permanent alteration of a person's genitals, violates their right to physical integrity. Individuals should have the autonomy to decide what modifications, if any, are made to their bodies when they are capable of understanding the consequences and giving informed consent.",whenyourupyourup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/1399a7u/how_and_why_is_male_circumcision_legal_in_the_usa/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/1399a7u/how_and_why_is_male_circumcision_legal_in_the_usa/,77,2023-05-06 02:27:14,13,,False,0.78,None,2024-09-14 12:17:04.808709

Without this designation, would companies have less influence or more?  Would that make the representative more beholden to constituents?

All I can think of are good things, but like everything I am sure there are good counterpoints why this was needed and would be bad.

Just feel like lobbying in general is almost indistinguishable from corruption.  Companies have huge interest and pockets to go hire lobbyists.  

The things companies lobby for are for their shareholders interest, often not the workers.  Like I never heard of the construction companies lobbying for improved health conditions for workers.

Askpolitics,175x75x,The Unorganized Militia,"I recently became aware of something called the ""Unorganized Militia"" in US Law:

Title 10 of the US Code:
§246. Militia: composition and classes
(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.
(b) The classes of the militia are—
(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and
(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

There are no additional laws regarding the Unorganized Militia.  However, per the Constitution...

Article 1, Section 8: [the Congress shall have Power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress...

Article 2, Section 2: The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.

It appears that there is a legal group called the Unorganized Militia consisting of all able bodied men between the age of 17 and 45, they have no State appointed officers, receive no training prescribed by Congress, but are legally required to answer to the President as their commander in chief if called into service.  This also appears to be different from Selective Service which is defined and has actual requirements.

Why does the Unorganized Militia exist?  Why do we have a legal entity with no requirements?  Should this be removed from law?  Is Congress supposed to determine a training regime for every man between 17 and 45?  What gives?",Captain-Radical,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/175x75x/the_unorganized_militia/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/175x75x/the_unorganized_militia/,14,2023-10-12 03:29:32,4,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:17:04.808709

I was raised independent but in Texas and very conservative-leaning, even if my parents didn't consider themselves Republicans at the time.

Askpolitics,18dy1uv,Is it more feasible to ensure high quality for as many as possible or lower quality for accessibility to the masses?,"Hey, I'm writing a narrative featuring my favorite political dilemma; should the goal be to ensure the highest quality or the greatest accessiblity?

I apply this to everything, all the time. I believe that when the goal is widest access, a dip in quality has to be expected. And most people's demands for higher quality don't come with an acknowledgement of limited resources. They just *wish* for higher quality and *hope* that educated, well-trained, properly funded help just solves the problem for them. 

So when I say ""lower quality"" I don't mean bad. I just mean, not luxury, not middle class, fully paid service. So often, I advocate for solutions that works towards the greatest accessiblity possible, and it is an answer that incorporates the most ""do-it-yourselfism"", minimalism, education, and automation. And people who disagree with me usually have an air of ""that's not dignified/good enough"" to their rebuttals and a demand for ""higher quality"". Some examples,

Homelessness and Homeownership: I believe the most ""amount"" of house to give someone with limited income is just enough house that they can clean, fix, and maintain *by themselves*. (With attention paid to educating them on that, too.) So many problems I've seen in addressing homes has come from well-meaning people calculating the cost of the home, but not the cost of the concierge of services required to maintain the home, as they encourage people to buy houses that require an instant elevation to middle class thinking and lifestyle to maintain. Because from their perspective, smaller, more rugged housing is undignified. 

Food: I think everyone should cook. But I also think most people only need to know 3-5 dishes, only need a pot, a skillet and one good chef knife, and about a dozen ingredients they buy regularly. When people shake their fists to the heavens and say that it's impossible to eat healthy when melons and oranges cost so much, I point out that red bell peppers and broccoli have more Vitamin C at a lower cost. People can eat plenty of fruits without picking up exotic tropical ones: tomato, zucchini, and cucumber. There. 

Education: If all you ever have is a middle school education, you were still taught to read and how to write a 5-paragraph research essay using critical thinking questions and a bibliography. The simplicity and pervasiveness of literacy, and yet our unwillingness to educate ourselves for the next 60 years of our lives, shows me how much we use the excuse of demanding higher quality to avoid providing and using the greatest access. ""But did a college educated teacher get paid a salary to make me learn this?! Then how can I possibly learn it. By just reading this book?!"" 

So at this point, I'm willing to acknowledge the pragmatism that human behavior wants to feel good by having ""the best."" Plenty of times people ignore simple solutions because they don't feel good. 

But I can't think of that many examples in real life where the demand for the best actually led to the most ethical outcome that helped the most people. I have even walked away from a steering committee that was designing a grocery store to put in an African-American neighborhood because other people on the steering committee demanded ""the best"". They didn't want whole foods that African Americans were more likely to eat, they wanted whole foods you would find at Whole Foods. And they acknowledged that people would likely not buy these foods, but their presence would elevate the grocery store and give people a better self-esteem, and that that was just as important of a goal as the grocery store being profitable and selling its inventory. 

I've also walked away from programs for what seems like the opposite reason. When addressing why some senior citizens quietly starve in their homes, I've pointed out to my program manager that it's simply an issue of getting prepared food delivered to them. (This was before the pandemic, back when ""deliverying groceries by Internet"" was still a joke.) I wanted to make a service and my program manager felt that was too expensive and acted as if it would help the most people to expect these elderly people to come to their location. Duh, if they can't get to the grocery store, why could they get to our office building? We need to provide a service. 

So, I CAN make an argument that high-quality service can sometimes help more than lower quality rugged individualism... But the examples are few and far between. It makes more sense to pay stipends and provide training for people to care for their own families than assume and wish and hope you can get enough people to make careers out of taking care of all of our grandmothers. It makes more sense to pay for gardening seeds with food stamp cards then think that you can get high quality grocery stores in every square inch of America. But ""food desert"" research is based ONLY on measuring how many high-quality grocery stores are in a zip code. 8/10 times, I don't think demanding that the standard be high-quality is the right decision.",ProserpinaFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/18dy1uv/is_it_more_feasible_to_ensure_high_quality_for_as/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/18dy1uv/is_it_more_feasible_to_ensure_high_quality_for_as/,4,2023-12-08 22:08:09,3,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:17:04.808709

Askpolitics,17xn88d,Why did Republicans split the continuing resolution to fund the US government into two steps?,"Instead of passing one continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown by funding the government until a certain date, Republicans in the House split it into two separate bills.  One funds some parts of the government until January 19th, and the other funds the rest of the government until February 2nd.  House Speaker Johnson keeps saying this is some great new revolutionary strategy that's much better than a regular continuing resolution, but none of the news articles I've found that cover this explain what's so great about it.  Or even what Republicans love about it, even if that is actually a bad thing for the rest of us.  They just don't explain at all.

Speaker Johnson keeps saying this is great because it avoids having Congress vote on a big new government spending package just before the holidays, when nobody has time to read it.  News articles keep repeating that claim.  But if they'd just passed one single CR that funds the whole government until some date in January or February, that would also have the same effect, no big votes just before the holidays.  So this doesn't explain why it's split into two steps.

Another thing I've read is that hard-right Republicans wanted to put the parts of government they really want to avoid shutting down - because their voter would be upset - into the first bill.  Things like the military.  Then, they force Congress to come to some deal about that before the first deadline, and then Republicans don't really care about shutting down all the other parts of government so they don't have to agree to a deal on the second deadline.  They can just let all those parts of government shut down until Democrats agree to everything they demand.

But... military ended up in the second bill, the one that goes until February 2nd.  While other parts of the government that Republicans care about and don't want to shut down, are in the first bill with the earlier deadline.  Which means they can't just ignore either deadline.

So what's going on?  Why did they do it this why?  Why do they think it's better than just one bill like in the past?",mqst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/17xn88d/why_did_republicans_split_the_continuing/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/17xn88d/why_did_republicans_split_the_continuing/,1,2023-11-17 19:42:24,3,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:17:04.808709
