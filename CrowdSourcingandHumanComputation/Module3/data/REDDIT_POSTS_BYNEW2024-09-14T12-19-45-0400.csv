DeepThoughts,1fgpkec,"Unbiased perspectives are impossible, and those who claim to have one are simply covering up their intellectual cowardice","Many people confuse being biased with being intentionally deceptive. 

While bias refers to the subconscious influence being human has on any individual's incomplete human perspective, many people will consider themselves unbiased merely because they aren't actively trying to be deceptive.

Between this and strict adherence to conflicting dogma, its no wonder that all public discourse has devolved.

  
Being unbiased is impossible, and trying to debate from a position of no bias is intellectually disingenuous and manipulative. While much of our society has encouraged this practice, I fear this is only because those who influence our society the most would rather us stay bickering rather than having productive dialogues.

Let's explore the Myth of Neutrality, Hiding Behind Objectivity, and the Comfort of Neutrality. 

Then I'll close with why authentic bias is actually great and mandatory for healthy public discourse. 



# The Myth of Neutrality

The concept of an ""unbiased perspective"" suggests a kind of detached, purely objective viewpoint—a stance outside the messy world of human subjectivity. Yet, humans are never truly neutral observers. We can't stop seeing through our little monkey eyes. Our perception of reality is always shaped by our experiences, cultural norms, personal histories, and the conceptual frameworks we've absorbed. In fact, the very act of observation in science (or any intellectual pursuit) requires interpretation, and interpretation is inherently subjective.

It is impossible to be aware of how all of these things that shape our perspective are doing so in real time.

People who claim neutrality or objectivity often fail to acknowledge the influence of these forces on their thinking. They might pride themselves on adhering strictly to ""facts"" or ""data,"" but even those facts and data are embedded within broader paradigms, interpretations, and biases that they might not recognize or be willing to confront. So, the claim of an ""unbiased perspective"" can often be a form of self-deception, an unwillingness to admit that they, too, are situated within a particular worldview.



# Hiding Behind Objectivity

In intellectual discourse, objectivity serves as a sort of a smothering force in two ways.

First, when someone insists they are operating from an ""unbiased"" or ""objective"" viewpoint, it often serves as a way to avoid the hard work of self-reflection. This is something that has impact on our understanding before we even try to convince anyone else of anything. If we allow ourselves to believe that we're neutral, we sidestep the responsibility of examining how our own biases, assumptions, and limitations shape our understanding. We can dismiss competing perspectives as ""biased"" or ""irrational"" without ever truly engaging with the complexity of those viewpoints. All in all, this manifests as a sort of nasty hypocrisy that many people will just give into because it's easier.

This is particularly evident in fields like science or politics, where the appeal to objectivity often masks deeper biases. In science, for example, the selection of research topics, methodologies, and even the interpretation of results is influenced by funding sources, societal trends, and cultural values. In politics, claims of objectivity often cloak ideological positions, allowing the claimant to evade criticism by framing their views as simply ""common sense"" or ""rational.""

  
The second way objectivity ruins intellectual discourse is by introducing a power dynamic that people feel the need to compete over. Intellectual politics stops being about who has the best point in the moment and is deferred to whoever has positioned themselves as the champions of objectivity. In this sense, objectivity quickly becomes just another tool for reinforcing the norm and silencing dissent- the exact opposite of the intent of science. That beautiful tool of anarchy that people wrongfully cite as justification for their authoritative rule. But that's a complaint for another day.

This power dynamic is also present in politics, but politics is known to be a disgraceful cesspool. So let's talk about this dynamic in science and academia, where people are literally paid to be smarter than the rest of us as their service to society. In science and academia, the selection of research topics, methodologies, and even the interpretation of results is influenced by funding sources, societal trends, and cultural values. And they get to silent any dissenting voices as champions of objectivity.

All in all, claiming any sort of objectivity is nothing but the manipulations of a cowardly cunt that cares more about you agreeing with them than actually collaborating on determining the truth.



# The Comfort of Neutrality 

One last gripe with objectivity before getting into why bias is actually good: neutrality will always justify inaction, and thus represents the position of people who never wish to do anything. 

Society has conditioned many to be conflict avoidant- not because conflict is bad, but because it leads to change. And our society is designed to minimized unpredictable change to stabilize profits. 

Don't want to get too distracted there, but the point is that people don't choose neutrality or objectivity because of any sort of intellectual purity, they choose it because it allows them to stay in their emotional safe space. They don't want to be seen by one social authority supporting another social authority. It's not about the truth, it's about personal protection in a harsh authoritarian hellhole. 

A truly neutral perspective requires being so apathetic about your own life that you don't care about the social consequences of challenging authority. And while I certainly check that box, even still, I'm biased as hell. I can't stop feeling, and I can't stop being a biological sack filtering reality. It's just what it is.

And without neutrality actually existing, all that's left are these ulterior motives that I've discussed.



# Why Bias is Based

Bias is a good thing. The reason why bias is good, is because bias is real. We are all very real people, living in a very real world with each other. It's important for us to acknowledge how this impacts us and others plainly. 

We live in an authoritarian society, and that means authority is a hot commodity. Certainty projects itself as authority biologically. When people can act confident and people believe the information they are saying, they have authority. 

Objectivity is a dark intellectual concept used to mimic this natural authority and be able to subsequently control who is allowed to call themselves objective. 

When you're dealing with authentic bias- that is someone who is being themselves and expressing their opinions with no filter regardless of perceived accuracy, you're getting a diverse human perspective approved by genuine intuition- an information processing system that's been developed over thousands of years and is damn near guaranteed to be a better decision making engine than anything we consciously come up with ourselves. 

When you have requirements of objectivity, people don't give their honest perspectives. Because honestly, they're biased. Humans are biased. At a certain point, when you require objectivity, the only people left to debate are liars. 

Authentic bias shows that someone is being honest, and is evidenced by quick answers and an open mind to new information. Ironically, objectivity is almost always used as an excuse to refuse considering alternative perspectives.

""I'm not even going to consider your biased nonsense"" can become an effective tool for someone not looking to examine how a different perspective challenges their own biased nonsense.

Those who admit their biases are not weakened by this admission—they are strengthened, because they are more capable of engaging deeply with the world. Intellectual cowardice, on the other hand, comes from those who deny their biases, because they are hiding from the difficult task of self-examination and critical thinking.





# Conclusion

The claim to have an unbiased perspective is often a shield for intellectual cowardice. It allows people to avoid self-reflection, evade challenging conversations, and cling to a false sense of certainty. Not only that, but perceived objectivity can be regulated by malicious authorities to prevent dissenting opinions.

True intellectual courage comes from acknowledging the inevitability of bias, engaging with different perspectives, and embracing the complexity of the human experience. Rather than pretending to be neutral, we should strive to be intellectually honest, constantly questioning our assumptions and remaining open to new ways of understanding.",nielsenson,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1fgpkec/unbiased_perspectives_are_impossible_and_those/,/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1fgpkec/unbiased_perspectives_are_impossible_and_those/,1,2024-09-14 16:08:34,2,,False,0.75,None,2024-09-14 12:18:55.069759

WaterTreatment,1fgpibj,Well water blue filter,"I want to apologize now as my terminology is going to be weak at best.

So I live on a well and have the typical bladder, 2 tanks, salt tank, etc. Originally when we bought the home it had a UV light and the big blue filter as well. I have continued to change the UV light and Big blue filter each year as we do not have a chlorine system yet (have been debating adding it as I have heard the UV does very little for a residential well). 

This morning the water pressure was very low and we called out a tech. He eventually removed the filter inside the blue hanging cartridge and the water flow went back to normal. The UV light and filter that was removed was changed about 90 days ago. He told me to simply leave the filter out as we didn't need it. 

1. I have always heard this filter is important as when we remove it, it is covered in a bunch of black stuff and what looks like algie. I'm a bit surprised that it would clog after only 90 days. Should I not put in a brand new one? I figured they served a purpose.

2. Does anyone know what could have caused thr clog that once the filter was removed everything went back to normal?

conspiracy,1fgpgdz,Why did opium production in Afghanistan fall by 99% after the US military left?,"Here's a timeline summarizing key facts and historical events related to opium production in Afghanistan, particularly in the context of U.S. military involvement and its aftermath:

Timeline of Opium Production in Afghanistan

1979–1989: Soviet-Afghan War and the Rise of Opium

- During the Soviet invasion, various Afghan factions, especially the Mujahideen, started relying on opium production to fund their insurgency efforts.
- Opium cultivation rapidly expanded, and Afghanistan began emerging as a major global supplier.

1994–1996: Taliban Emergence

- The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, initially tolerating opium production as a necessary evil to maintain their rule.
- By the late 1990s, Afghanistan accounted for a significant portion of the world’s opium supply.

2000: Taliban Ban on Opium

- In July 2000, Taliban leader Mullah Omar issued a decree banning opium production in areas under Taliban control.
- By 2001, the UN confirmed that opium production in Taliban-controlled areas had dropped by over 90%, with cultivation reduced from around 82,000 hectares to just 8,000 hectares.

October 2001: U.S. Invasion of Afghanistan

- Following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, and the Taliban regime was overthrown.
- Opium production resurged, particularly as the U.S.-backed Afghan government struggled to establish control over rural areas.
- From 2002–2021, Afghanistan became the world’s largest opium producer, accounting for around 85–90% of global supply.

2002–2021: U.S. Military Presence and Rise of Opium

- Despite billions of dollars spent on anti-narcotics programs, opium production continued to thrive, often seen as a source of livelihood for poor farmers and a means of funding various factions, including the Taliban insurgency.
- By 2020, opium cultivation reached one of its highest levels in two decades.

August 2021: U.S. Withdrawal and Taliban Takeover

- In August 2021, the U.S. military officially withdrew from Afghanistan, and the Taliban quickly regained control.
- By this time, opium production was a major part of the Afghan economy, involving hundreds of thousands of farmers.

April 2022: Taliban’s New Opium Ban

- In April 2022, the Taliban reintroduced a nationwide ban on opium cultivation, similar to their previous decree in 2000.
- This ban was publicly declared by Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, warning farmers that they would face consequences for violating the edict.
- The ban came at a time when Afghanistan was facing economic collapse, with the Taliban potentially seeking international legitimacy and aid.

2022–2023: Impact of the Taliban’s Ban

- According to UN reports, opium production in Afghanistan dropped by over 90% in 2023, attributed to strict enforcement of the Taliban’s ban.
- The drop had a profound impact on global heroin supplies, with shortages reported in some regions.
- The Taliban’s motivations for enforcing the ban are debated, ranging from securing international recognition to attempting to end dependency on the drug trade as part of broader economic reforms.

---

This timeline outlines the broader context in which Afghanistan's opium production has fluctuated, driven by political, military, and economic factors. The significant drop in opium production post-U.S. withdrawal reflects the Taliban’s renewed commitment to banning cultivation, likely tied to their pursuit of international legitimacy.",appleman33145,https://i.redd.it/9ye27mfvssod1.jpeg,/r/conspiracy/comments/1fgpgdz/why_did_opium_production_in_afghanistan_fall_by/,5,2024-09-14 16:03:39,8,,False,0.9,None,2024-09-14 12:18:55.069759

the_everything_bubble,1fgpfoq,Trump is no longer trying to win the election,"
The word is out.  Trump is no longer trying to win the election.

It’s very obvious now that Trump is not trying to win the election.

Why else would he go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things he did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let’s be honest.  Trump wants to lose.  Why else would he go on a the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

 He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Why else would he go on a debate stage and refuse to support Poland against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine?

He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Trump knows he’s going to lose but he is using his air time to make a push for another run in the entertainment industry.  Trump will be a consultant in a movie about his political career.

He won’t play himself.  Instead the role of Trump will go to Ric Flair, the ex-professional wrestler known as the “dirtiest wrestler” in the game.

Flair was very popular for his bleached blond hair and carnival barking style.  Thousands of wrestling fans believed his act was real and they adored him much like Trump supporters adore Trump.

Dolly Parton is being courted to star as Stormy Daniels, the American pornographic film actress and former stripper.

Trump’s extras in the movie will be picked in a pecking order with the first opportunities going to the “patriots” who attacked the Capitol.

The secondary roles will go to former MAGAs who were not part of the attack but supported MAGA.

MAGA movie extra hopefuls will have to bring a red MAGA cap to be considered as an extra for the movie: “Trump.

SquaredCircle,1fgpf72,Could Cody Rhodes Work As A Heel? ,"Cody Rhodes has been WWEs top guy since Wrestlemania but since the Roman Reigns return there has been that debate of who is the more popular of the two. You'd think based off of last night's reactions that Roman has the edge on Cody here and that looked to get somewhat under Codys skin even though Cody did what he always does and made a judgment call to step in and aid Roman in his fight with The Bloodline. Cody can't help himself but to ""do the right thing by someone"" even when he said earlier that he was ""done"".

But there's something here that makes you wonder if they had the nerve... Could they make Rhodes a heel in all of this? And this isn't just with Roman.. You can even go back to Rhodes mini feud with his friend, Kevin Owens. Even though Rhodes didn't mean to he did come off as condescending to a degree in his promos to KO. Owens felt like it was a pity party as a result. Cody spoke about leaving friends behind him as he blazed a trail to his path of glory and saw that as angering Owens. Even though he didn't want to it seemed like Cody took every chance he got to push KOs buttons. Could you argue that he just wanted to bring fire out in his friend? Yes you can.. But maybe part of Cody is just smug enough to enjoy this kind of thing?

Last night he took exception to Roman claiming that WWE was still his and he didn't need Codys help. Cody with somewhat bitter undertones claimed that it was no longer Romans WWE.. not since Wrestlemania. Something that the crowd appeared divided on. It was almost like Cody took himself out of the spotlight and when there was claim that he (the champion) wasn't needed.. That it wasn't his company.. He took exception. Jealousy reared it's ugly head. Notice how it was Cody that asked Roman to hand over the contract to sign. He wanted the control of him being in the match to be on him. He wanted Reigns to pass the contract to him almost like he was passing the power over to him.

Of course Cody is going to remain a babyface. So is Roman.. But you could eventually use Codys reactions to things to set up that eventual match with Randy Orton. People are waiting for Orton to turn on Rhodes but Randy is also quite popular... So what if the unthinkable happens and it's Cody that turns on Orton? That despite all Cody has done for the company and to get fans on board with him being the face of the company they still believe that he is going to lose to a future HOFer in Randy Orton.

Orton could be painted as Rhodes superior in the past and you could do interviews questioning if Rhodes has what it takes to overcome his mentor. Imagine the anger boiling underneath for Cody as he watches talking heads claim that Randy is better than him and that Rhodes might not pull this one out? He could snap. A guy trying so hard to be the hero for the company only to be undermined time after time. He's bitter but refuses to show it. You could get that Homelander version of Rhodes that people wanted in AEW in WWE.

I enjoy Codys work but for some reason as solid as his matches and stuff have been people are finding it tough to take to his babyface title run. Im not completely sure why but his character has developed at the same time that if they wanted to they could flip the switch with Rhodes and turn him at any time freshening him up and in turn bringing a newer side to this current title reign.

SaaS,1fgp6na,SaaS MVP Service - Marketing Ideas,"Hey Everyone!

This month I finally launched a project that I was debating not doing for months as I was never sure if there was a big enough market for the idea, a SaaS MVP service designed to make your SaaS ideas into fully functioning MVPs quickly and affordably.

We thought we'd trial some paid ads out on this service including Google, Reddit and X mainly targeting followers of large SaaS public creators and keywords like ""SaaS MVP Developer"". Although the success of these Ads has been very limited, at least the CPA has been far greater than what we expected at $400+.

Maybe we're targeting wrong? Or maybe our website isn't a convincing enough offer? As a result of this, today I paused all of our campaigns and I'm setting off on a mission to understand what's going wrong and why the uptake has been very weak. Any suggestions on what could be going wrong would be incredibly appreciated!

guineapigs,1fgp4dy,Any help? ,"Hi! I’ll start with some back story but here’s the TLDR: woman rehomes children’s pet guinea to me, super underweight and might need vet help for URI. Is it wrong to ask for my “rehoming fee” back as he is not healthy, nor did I take any supplies.


So! I have two bonded pigs (Male/4yo and Male/1.5) in a 4x2 C&C with fleece. Besides the point just expressing my long time ownership. I brought in a single male in a Midwest from someone who reached out to me. I’ve been looking for opportunities to find another male to attempt to bond with him, then follow with cage expansion, etc. I am active in rescues and rehoming pages in my city, a woman reached out on a post rehoming her 4yo solo male guinea pig as her “son is now starting school and can’t take care of him” (I believe the son is also 4, this guinea seems like a child’s pet🙄😬). 

Anyway, we schedule a meet up and she requests a “rehoming fee”. I’m hesitant but I pay it. She was advertising the cage and supplies as well, although I have extra quarantine cages/midwests so I took nothing although she provided shitty pellet food. 


I take him home to examine him (this happened today), he is severely underweight for a grown male guinea pig. Additionally, I hear some altered breathing (not awful, I’ve heard awful and this isn’t to that extent). But now im debating a vet trip. I plan on supplementing with critical care, a veggie routine, science selective pellets (hay & water too, duh lol). 

More or less im asking this group for advice, would it be appropriate to bring this up with this woman and discuss that “rehoming fee”. I understand paying it, and it’s why I did. But to be handed a piggie in this state as now MY responsibility bc she was “getting rid of him” seems ridiculous. Or should I bite my tongue bc I knew what I could get into? Lmk.

BreakUps,1fgp214,"First time using Reddit, just need some support here"," (it’s a long one sorry but I think context here matters for me to get it off my chest)

My ex and I broke up a few months ago because our relationship started to feel stagnant. We were together for a year and a couple months. She was going to be graduating college and I was going to stay for another year and she didn’t know what she going to be doing. We were both sort of avoiding what we should do (i probably was the bigger offender of that unfortunately). But during that last semester towards the end it felt like we were both distancing ourselves somewhat. School ended for about a week and we were both in our respective hometowns. Eventually she said she was coming to me and that she wanted to talk. I knew where this was going and it sucked but I just kept thinking maybe it’s for the best. She loved me a lot and I did too, even when we broke up she said “I wish I was that person for you”. all in all it ended on good terms and even had goodbye sex and I let her stay the night.

After the breakup, we talked everyday like normal for about 2 weeks then all of a sudden it stopped. We went no contact for about 2 weeks and during that time, I thought a lot about where things went wrong. I realized I still had strong feelings for her and that I wasn’t ready to fully let go. I realized that I should have done and said those little things to make her happy. I felt incredible guilt that I ruined a loving relationship and that maybe towards the end I didn’t give it the full chance it deserved. I know I wasn’t an awful bf and she would reassure me sometimes saying how great I was and that I was sensitive and such a good listener and all that jazz. I realized I said some stupid things when we were together like how I didn’t want kids. Like I’m 20-22 when I’m saying this idk where I’m going to be at in life in 5-10 years from now and what kinda person I’d be. 

It could have been rose colored glasses but I also recognized that she wasn’t perfect either. If something upset us we both never really talked about it and kinda of shut down and remain upset. However that didn’t happen often and we never real fought. 

After some time debating I reached out to her about 3 weeks or so after the breakup asking how she was and that I missed her. We talked on the phone for a while and telling her that I’m trying to be better and fix my own problems, that I was looking into therapy for my anxiety issues and going to the gym more and spending more time with friends. She was happy to hear but eventually said she doesn’t see us getting back together and that she’s moved on. That hurt knowing how quickly she moved on. From there though we started talking again. And after some time we ended up talking more than we did when we were together. Eventually she found that that she might stay up in the college town for her job for another year which if we knew that before we broke up we probably would still be together 

It was hard because we were still apart for the summer but she would express that she missed me and wished I was there with her. At some point I had to make a visit in our college town and asked if she wanted to catch up and she agreed. On my way up though she said she didn’t know if it was a good idea and that she doesn’t want to get the wrong impression. Eventually we just ended up going to her place and talked and hung out for a while and it was really nice. It was awkward with her but she would initiate the physical touch and I could tell she was happy to see me. 

Eventually one of her friends called her and basically said she was coming to pick her up. She panicked bc she hasn’t told her that me and her still talk because they think it’s a bad idea. My ex said that that one friend especially harped on her because she said we’re not compatible and that we’re just going to end up hurt and basically convincing her that she doesn’t want me back. She expressed that she felt like she was hiding me from them bc she knew that would be upset with her. Anyway, as she’s going out the door she says to me that she is talking to someone else and really likes him and that she just wanted to be honest. Yeah that one hurt as at this point still probably like 3 or so weeks after the breakup.

Anyway after I went back to my hometown the next day, we were still talking. We kept this up for the rest of the summer even while she was involved with someone else. Sometimes I would bring it up and she would say that I’m making it more serious than it is and that she felt bad because she felt like she was using him like if she said she was hungry they’d get food. 

We eventually met up at a drive in theater to hang out that was in between our hometowns. I really wasn’t expecting anything but enjoying our company but again she was initiating the hugs and cuddling and whatnot. When we got close she said she was afraid to kiss bc she didn’t know if she was going to feel anything. I just went for it and she was fully on board after that and we ended up having sex in the backseat. It was still great afterwards and she asked if I had been with anyone since we broke up and I said I haven’t and she said she hasn’t either. (Now I’m not so sure but maybe she was telling the truth)

Like I said we were talking about lot and facetiming almost every night even after that. Every now again the subject of us would come up and there were some insights I would get. Like one time she said that we couldn’t get back together because her friends and family wouldn’t approve because they have that “once and ex always an ex” mindset and said before that she doesn’t want to tell me there’s a chance but in the back of her mind she thinks there is one.

Probably about 2 weeks before I was going back up to school. She called me in the phone and somehow she brought up the guy. I’ve expressed to her before that I really didn’t want to her about him. She said “yeah just gotta let you know there’s no chance” in a joking way. I kinda brushed it off and we were sort of planning on meeting up again. I casually mentioned I might end up late and she asked why. I really didn’t want to answer but if she was honest with me about seeing someone else I thought I’d be honest and told her I might have a date. She got really sad and quiet after that and got off the phone pretty quick. I spiraled after that thinking I ruined any progress even though it wasn’t fair to me that she’d would be upset if she’s doing the same thing. 

Eventually after talking about it with my sister and cousin, we all came to the conclusion that we needed space. I have been pretty clear that I wanted to talk things slow, talk and hang out and see if that connection could build again and we could have something new and better because I genuinely believed that. I left her alone the rest of the day and called her that night telling her that she knows I still love her and that she told me that there’s a small chance and that I’d do anything for that chance. She kept giving me these mixed signals and saying she doesn’t know what she wants and that this would help get past the emotional highs and we could both have some clarity. More insights came and she said she was afraid that things would go back to the way it was and I expressed I was afraid too but that I wanted to try. She also said that she feels like she sabotages and that there isn’t a good relationship she could point to in her family and that she sets higher standards (which I told her i understood bc her past relationship was borderline emotionally abusive from what I’ve gathered and he went genuinely mentally insane sometime after they broke up but that’s a whole other story). Toward the end of that call I told her I was afraid because we have both expressed in the past that we want each other in our lives and I felt like we were never gonna talk again. She said she didn’t want that to happen but she felt like it might turn out that way. That definitely hurt.

The 2 weeks of no contact was hell. I was constantly thinking about her and being depressed and getting little sleep. The first bit I was planning when I should break no contact once we both had some time for me to settle into school and her at her new job in the college. But after some time I was still sad but was less sure that I would or should break no contact. I’ve expressed how I felt and it was up to her to reach out. After some more time, I figured she won’t reach out and I was making my peace with it even though it was crushing.

After two weeks of no contact and I had been up to college for a few days, she broke the no contact a few days she was also moving back up there. I updated my LinkedIn job update a few days before and she reached out saying “hey I saw your LinkedIn, congrats on getting the job :)” I thought it was odd that she would break no contact over something like that but that it meant that she missed me and wanted to talk again. A few days after we met up on her lunch break and again she was initiating the hugging and the hand holding and would put her head on my shoulders. I told her I didn’t expect her to reach back out and she was saying that she was really missing me.

Again, we kept talking and she eventually came over to my house and ended up staying the night and cuddling. It was really good and saying she missed me. She kept complimenting me, telling me I looked cute, and it felt like she could talk to me about anything more so than her friends. eventually she said I don’t think we should get back together and that she still talking to that guy. I told her i understand that we’re not together but again I want to see where things can go between us. she was still clear that she didn’t know what she wanted, and I was trying to be patient.

About a week of this and a couple more causal hangouts she left me on read over a weekend which she never did. I honestly got pretty upset because I thought she was gonna ghost me and felt pissed that she would do that knowing how I felt about her. 

She reached back out just asking me “how was your weekend” completely disregarding the conversations we were having before which honestly made me more pissed because it felt like she was treating me like nothing. I didn’t even know if I was going to answer and was just gonna maybe text her back the next day. After an hour she double texted me basically reframing that question and I ignored it. She called me a few minutes later and she was pretty sad. She told me how her and that guy ended badly because she got drunk and kissed some guy at the bar. She was saying she felt awful and that she didn’t know what made her do that. I was honestly surprised it just seemed so unlike her. Honestly I was trying to be supportive and not be too hard on her saying that yeah that was messed up but you made a mistake and that doesn’t make you a bad person. She asked me if she should apologize and I told her she should do what she feels right bc I don’t know what their dynamic was. This was honestly just my way of seeing what her choices were (which she did and she told me a few days later) she also said she feels bad that she feels like I’ve given her so many chances and that it’s like she’s trying to have her cake and eat it too. Towards the end of that call she asked me if she still wants to talk and hang out and I told her yes that my stance on what I’ve expressed has still not changed.

So that’s what we did, kept talking and hanging out and everything was good. After about a week she said that the guy texted her saying he missed her. I asked her if she texted him and wanted to get things back on track with him. In my mind if she did then I would have ended things there because she’s choosing him over me essentially. She said that she was sad and that she was over him and didn’t really see anything with him. Yet again, I was clear that I wanted to talk and hang out and see where things could go and she expressed she wants the same. I thought with this guy out of the picture we could actually start doing more date-like stuff which she said sounded really fun and that she wanted to do more fun things with me.

Maybe the next day, she told me she wanted to see me and hang out and i eventually went to her place and we hooked up. Again she initiated all the kissing and the hugging telling me how much she missed it. What threw me off was she said “I love you. Can we pretend like everything is normal for a little while” which I caved to ig. After that it was really good she was talking to me more and giving me updates and what she was doing expressing that she wishes she could see me.

Literally a few days after things shifted out of nowhere. She became more distant with her texts, going hot and cold from rapid fire texting to then just pretty much ignoring me after like 6 pm until the next morning like everyday for the next handful of days. (It makes it sound like that guy or someone else was involved but that wasn’t the case trust me lol) she was basically avoiding me. I’ve tried asking her to hang out or grab food, but she either ignores my invitation or comes up with an excuse after it’s too late. Despite being distant, she’d still send me memes on Instagram or react to my stories, which makes me feel like she’s keeping me on the hook without wanting to fully engage. The inconsistency was just very frustrating and confusing. Again it made me feel like I was being used and that I had no value and my feelings weren’t being considered. I called her to ask about it but she was basically falling asleep and told me she was stressed with work and that her friend (the one that thinks it’s a bad idea that we’re still talking and seeing each other) and that she was also thinking about the direction of where we were headed. She essentially fell asleep and I let her go. The next morning again she’s send me memes and talking and asked “did we call. I don’t remember” which I thought was pretty weird. Again, there were hot and cold interactions and mixed signals. After a few days, I just felt emotionally drained. I felt like I needed to communicate. That was an issue when we were together and something I’ve been actively working on. I told her to call me whenever she was free. 

I basically just told her straight up “Ok I’m just gonna lay it out bc I tried talking about this with you. I’ve made it clear that I’m serious about seeing where things could go between us, and it seemed like you felt the same way the last few times we hung out. But lately, it feels like you've been distant, and I'm honestly confused. It’s been such hot and cold interactions and mixed signals lately.

I’ve been putting in effort without trying to overwhelm and pressure you into anything, but it feels like things are getting avoided and that effort is not being reciprocated. Again, I’m not asking for a relationship or go back to the way things were but I want to know you are serious about seeing where things can go. If you’ve decided that you don’t want to give this a chance, I’d rather you tell me now. Or if you need some space or something else, I’d rather we have a real conversation to talk about it and figure it out. I just feel like I’m being strung along for reasons I really don’t understand. I know I’ve made mistakes but I think I deserve better than being treated like this bc it makes me feel like I have no value and that you don’t really care or that you’re keeping me around as a backup option”

She said that she was sorry and that she didn’t want to make me feel like that but she felt that we need a clean break and move on. She said that she saw the effort I was putting in and that she couldn’t give that back what I deserved. She told me that she feels like the romantic feelings aren’t there anymore. We talked and eventually she said “this might help you move on. I haven’t been really honest with you I still have some feeling for that other guy” yeah that one stung. I asked her to be honest with me if she was talking to that guy again to which she said no. She told me if she missed me or was lonely and she reached out to not let her back in my life bc she’s afraid this would happen again. All in all the conversation was pretty good and amicable and we ended it ok I guess.

I feel ok now that I have this clarity but I know once this all sets in it’s gonna get rough. I was constantly stressed thinking about what I could do or say to start winning her back. But towards the end I felt like I said and did everything I could. I suppose I’m just hurt that the feelings were no longer there when I could feel that there definitely was a connection pretty much everytime we hung out and talked. It just felt like this switched out of nowhere especially after such a high point. It really sucks that she didn’t even really wanna give it a chance. If she’s felt this way why was she keeping me around knowing full well my feelings for her and what I wanted. I’m just struggling because I’m still in the mindset of she’s the best I’ll ever do and she’s out of my league and feeling guilty that I ruined our relationship by not knowing what we had until I lost it. This whole thing just really took my sense of self worth down knowing how she feels now. I’m going to therapy to work on this and my anxiety problems and self esteem and confidence as well as going to the gym but it still just sucks and wish things were different. Yeah well that’s my rant",jj7140,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fgp214/first_time_using_reddit_just_need_some_support/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1fgp214/first_time_using_reddit_just_need_some_support/,1,2024-09-14 15:46:15,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:55.069759
electrolysis,1fgp1tn,Lessons from Session 2,"Due to a cancellation I was able to have my 2nd appt right at the 3 week mark from my 1st. I was originally scheduled for 6 weeks out because of how busy she is...not sure I would have made it that long. 

I did things slightly different and learned some lessons I thought I'd share. 
- I wasn't feeling great the day of my appointment. My body gets extremely achy when the weather first changes to cool and rainy. I had no fever and no other symptoms, so kept my appt. 

For my first appt I applied numbing cream about 90 mins before, then reapplied about 60 mins before. This time around I only applied once about 90 mins prior. 

I don't know if it was a combination of the two factors or one more than the other but holy heck was it a painful session. It was an hr long and probably by 30 mins in I was debating quitting after each zap but pushed through. 

After my first appt I had some redness for a few hours and that was about it. This time, I was pretty swollen for about 2 days. 

So - will be going back to the multiple applications of numbing cream and cancelling if I don't feel 100% (of course, the day before and the day after I felt absolutely fine). 

The good news is i can tell there's been progress. She was able to do all but a strip down my chin and that's really the only area I have to keep up with. 

Also, the most surprising part of all of this is that my compulsive desire to pluck has vanished. I was so scared that I would not be able to stop (it truly had become an addiction that took up hours of my day) but not once have I been tempted. So for others also worried about this- there is hope!

Enneagram,1fgp00v,I'm having a really hard time deciphering if I'm an 8w7 or 7w8 and what the difference between the two is,"So Ive gone through almost everything that I could find between the two both in past posts here, other websites, and research papers and both just sound extremely similar to my situation. 

To describe myself shortly I am generally easy going, or at least I try to be, however often if a topic comes up that I at least somewhat care about I'm willing to debate almost to the death about it until I'm proven wrong and accept that they're right or that they see that I'm right (that said if we're both clearly not gonna change our minds I give up). In life I generally want to be free to do whatever I want and not feel restricted in what I can do (although I am willing to concede some autonomy if it benefits me in a way that I deem to be worth it). I also generally don't want to harm others in whatever it is that I'm doing however if it came down to me doing what I wanted and not harming others, I'd do what I wanted. It's rare that I get angry and mostly when I do it comes off as passive aggressive or witty insults. And I'm rarely if ever serious with me being able to give my all and treat a subject as serious however I will be casual about it and often crack jokes (at my or someone above me power Wise's expense). Lastly I'm extremely stubborn and generally willing to go to great lengths to prove a point. Also don't know if this is important but I view family as important but if it came down to my dreams or family I'd pick my dreams (albeit part of my dreams is to have my own family).

Sorry if that was a lot of I sound like a horrible person, I'm just trying to be as honest as possible. That and I'm really lost as most things I've seen always phrase it as 8w7 wants power, control, and freedom while 7w8 wants freedom and to not be bogged down by choice but I'm kinda still stuck.

Also also one last thing is that I generally try to avoid negative feelings if possible but will tackle them head on if they get too big. I also don't have any real desire to control/manage other people; just want to do what I want without others getting in the way.

I went to the dealership yesterday thinking I would want a real wheel drive long range.  While I was there, I saw a 7 seater which only comes in all wheel drive - it seemed like it could come in handy if my kids' friends needed a ride etc. and 4 wheel drive would be nice.

1.  New 4 wheel drive 7 seater for about 55k
2.  New Long Range 2 wheel drive for about 50k
3.  Used, which varies.

I have the budget for 55K, wouldn't want to go much over that.  I do not qualify for the tax break.

exmuslim,1fgowim,Debate:Why Islam is not a progressive religion ? ,"I have an ongoing conversation with one of my friend. He believes that original Islam is pure and that Islam has been distorted by new folks to present a false narrative. The true Islam is a positive force. He strongly believes in Islamophobia and that Muslims are living under threat in the world for no mistake of their own.

He is of the opinion that Islam is inherently a progressive and good religion. I want to counter that. Here are my debating points, would love to hear more from others. 

Importance of Education/Literacy:
1. Tell me 5 Muslim women leaders across the world who are leading large organisations or women who are actively involved in STEM.
2. 25-30% of world population is Muslim. That means 1 in every 4 human should be a Muslim. What is this representation in corporations which require good quality education ? Like Tech companies, Research organizations, etc. ? 

Belief in co-existence:
1. Most of the countries in the world either have very low Muslim population (less than 10%) or very high, i.e. more than 80%. It's very tough to find countries with Muslim population in range 40-60%. Why is that ?

Star_Wars_Maps,1fgotgq,3D Star Wars Galaxy - Interactive Project,"Hi folks,

I’m excited to share with you my latest project: a 3D version of the Star Wars Galaxy map, built using multiple data sources from across the internet. [You can explore it here](https://star-wars-galaxy.vercel.app).

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive 3D version of the Star Wars galaxy, allowing users to visualize distances, planetary locations, and the dynamic of the universe. I've integrated a description system for planet discovery, and I’ve tried to stay true to the lore as much as possible. However, since Star Wars canon can be debated (and sometimes changed!), I’m relying on the community to help me ensure the map is as accurate and detailed as possible.

The map is based on various public data sources, wikis, and resources from across the web, and I’d like to give a special shoutout u/Otherlife_Art whose galaxy map laid the foundation for much of this work ([See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Star_Wars_Maps/comments/12yolnk/ultimate_star_wars_galaxy_map_online_update_and/)).

If you notice any inaccuracies regarding planet sizes, textures, rotations, or any other issues, I would love your input. If you wish, you can create an issue or even a PR on GitHub to help improve the project !

If you're into coding, you can check out the [technical side of the project on GitHub](https://github.com/pierredarrieutort/Star-Wars-Galaxy). There’s a guide for importing either pre-cleaned or dynamically extracted data, and I’ve also implemented [a debug view for in-depth testing](https://star-wars-galaxy.vercel.app#debug).

I'm eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions!

SprocketTankDesign,1fgor7v,Russian custom 'T-96MV' 50t+ Mbt,"I took theese pictures about a day ago, at the time I took them the tank was just 30t. After I have almost finished most of the hull, the tank has reached 50t. Why are all my MBTs super heavy?

Anyways, it features Alot of composite armour that contributes alot to it's massive size with additional ERA and Composite packages on the front and sides. 

I haven't modelled the turret yet but I know it will have either a 125, 135 or 152. It will have a similar turret design to the T90s, albeit more curved around the back. It will have something similar to the shorta OR I will add iron fists by adding 2 turrets the commander can control or just a rigid structure with fuel tanks as the 'Interceptors' (Both of them are just meant to make it look more modern I don't think they will ACTUALLY work) When adding the either 125-152mm armament, they will only be able to penetrate 150-200mm as I am thinking of giving up penetration for actual functionality (My other tanks could only penetrate 250-300mm at the cost of 3 degrees depression and elavation 💀💀)I'll probably keep it that way until the cannons can noclip through the turret or something idk

Now, I'm debating on the name, for now I am calling it the 'T-96MV' As to my knowledge (Please correct me if I am wrong) M stands for modernized due to its addition of Composite plates on the lower and Upper half of the hull Glacias, the V is the ERA applied on the upper Glacias (I spent 2 minutes researching it)

As of writing this with the outdated pictures, it can reach around 60Kmph forward and 4-8km backwards (Peak Russian reverse) I forgot to mention this but it does have composite armour blocks on its side and at it's rear sides a net cage, I will upload the image soon.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Hst-as, Sztot High Explorer**

**Date [Human Standardized Time]: October 19, 2136**

I have never been more interested in biology in my life.

I wasn't exactly trained in it, but even with my bare-branch understanding, I could easily tell just how odd and bizarre these alien plants were! The basic structures were the same, roots to draw in nutrients and water, stems with various types of tissue to move nutrients and saps throughout. Of course, these are just the types of plants that have such structures. I still need to see single-celled organisms and various kinds of aquatic plants…

They went through each section and explained what the plants were and the study they were doing. A fair amount of them were genetically altered, designed to be better suited for easier growth in artificial environments. For the most part, there was mixed success. They were growing just fine, but much too slow for their purposes, whatever they were.

Next, they explained The section with the teal and green plants. This was extremely hard to follow since they seemed to be *much* more well-versed in the specifics here than I was. From what little I could gather between the excited rant and trunk load of jargon, these were plants from different planets, especially Earth and Venlil Prime. Organisms from different planets were biologically incompatible, so they are trying to find a way to see if plants of different planets could somehow share a root system by trying out a variety of factors.

I'm about to ask about the plants set up without a purpose other than decoration before the botanist speaks first.

“What about you?”

“What about me?”

“What kind of plant are you? I see what looks to me like a few separate types of plants, so I can't quite pin down what to classify you as.” 

As they talk I feel as if they try to analyze every aspect of my body, looking it over with both a professional and personal curiosity. Not that I blame them, I find myself scanning them in return.

“Well, my species is-”

“Wait! Let me guess! I want to see if I can figure it out myself!”

“If you think you can, go right ahead” Well, this would be a great way to see how they categorize their plants too.

“Hmm… Well, I don't think you are made of one strict type of plant, the moss coating and the vines are too different, so I'm assuming they act like separate organs. I'd bet the moss acts as your primary means of photosynthesis, while the vines are more of your main body. This would classify you as an angiosperm, and you probably flower in that case!”

Not bad guesses! This one knows their stuff! 

“Then there's that matter of how you move. The most likely way you move is through the manipulation of fluid pressures within your vines. I know plants on Earth can achieve rapid movement through hydraulic systems similar to that. Of course, on your scale it's probably much more advanced.”

“I'm impressed! You got a lot of things right for just looking! I knew you knew a lot, but you meat lifeforms continue to surprise me!” 

The botanist's head changes hue to a deeper shade of blue, to an almost purple, I assume that's a response to what I said.

“You were right about my moss being my source of photosynthesis, although the sparseness of the leaves on my vines was probably a big clue. Not only that the kind I chose also provides me with extra sensory information, like temperature, humidity, and air pressure.”

The botanist seems to puff up in response, likely feeling proud that it could use its expertise to make accurate guesses about my biology.

“The hypothesis you made on my vines is half right. The outer ones are not of much use for flowering or movement, I chose to incorporate these for their ability to store sap effectively since I was preparing for a long journey. The vines that make up my main body are indeed used for movement, and yes by hydraulic pressure!”

The botanist makes a brief humming sound, something I said clearly intrigued them.

“What do you mean by “incorporate”, are they not part of your natural body?”

I feel a strange sense of pride, although I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe it's because I stumped them? It could also be I simply have the chance to share more about my kind to a form of life considered to be completely impossible. No matter the reason I collect myself to answer.

“No, they are not. They are different species of plants that are connected by special roots I have called “haustoria”. They allow me to connect to various root systems and interact with plants.”

“That's… wow… So if I'm understanding you right, that means you are a sort of parasite?”

“Yes, that's right! We use our haustoria to communicate with other plants and integrate them onto our main body.”

“That's incredible! I don't think any other plant in the galaxy does anything even remotely similar! Well, there are interconnected root systems that allow the sharing of nutrients but nothing like permanent additions to each other!”

“Well, only as permanent as needed. We can exchange plants and return them to a suitable environment.”

The alien stares at me in awe, their mind probably flying through ideas and concepts. I idly inspect some of the nearby plants, sensing the life flowing through them.

“Can it be any plant, or are there limitations?”

“Some plants will reject the process, but otherwise most plants can be assimilated.”

“So you can effectively act as a walking plant nursery then! That's just amazing. Do you only integrate plants for utility purposes?”

“Well, not always. Generally, any highly chlorophyll-dense plant will do. Outside of that, it's more of a personal choice since nutrition is shared among each other, so individual needs aren't as important. We still share with each other, but more as a way to handle personal exchanges. But that's just me rambling a little. In short, not usually, we integrate for decorative purposes for the most part.”

The alien doesn't seem to react. The information takes time to take root in their mind, which probably races through ideas faster than I could comprehend. I can't believe this one. I feel like once they settle a little bit it'll be never-ending questions! Well, I guess I should show them the process since they seem fashioned with me on both a professional and personal level.

“If I may, I could demonstrate the process.” I feel like I could do just about anything and they would show excitement, no matter how mundane.

“Really? That would be amazing!”

I look around at the various plants, analyzing each and every one. Which should I pick? I probably shouldn't disturb the experiments, as much as a choice I have there. Maybe that decorative section would be fine. Particularly that one with the beads of sap on the outside…

“First, I have one big question”

“Oh! Sure, what is it?”

“How, if at all, does this affect the attached plant?”

I love answering these questions! I may not be a medical expert, but it's great pretending to be one!

“Well,” I start with completely unearned authority “that depends on the plant. In general, they remain unchanged. However, if a plant is used to growing in nutrient-poor environments the sudden burst in available nutrition can cause it to grow much larger than it otherwise should”

“Well, then whichever plant you integrate will be an excellent study into the biocompatibility of alien plants! It can show things like how your…”

They rattle off a long series of jargon I have no hope of understanding. And they go on.

 And on.

 **And on.**

*How are they still going?*

 Well, it was fun to play expert before immediately getting outdone by an actual expert. Fantastically smart move on my part. I'll just inch over to the decorative plants and check them out while they talk. However, as I get closer they seem to get quieter and quieter. Oh no, did I offend them?

“S-Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, I just thought one of these plants would be good to integrate since they don't seem to be part of an experiment.”

The botanist rubs their vine-like appendages together as they remain silent. This does not appear to show they've taken offense but something has happened. Something about these plants set them apart from the rest in a way I didn't quite understand. 

“Th-those plants aren't quite decorative, and they aren't quite experiments…”

“What do you mean?”

They are abnormally still, a far cry from their excited rambling from a moment ago. They go to speak but stop several times. Clearly, these are different in some way, something they seem to want to avoid. As much as I don't want to impose, my curiosity drives me to press them for answers.

“What do you mean?” I repeat, trying to snap their attention back to me. Their excitement has now been replaced by caution as if a wrong move would cause them to explode.

“These plants are unique specimens from Earth… as a symbol of sorts.” I get the impression of unease from them as they speak. “Humans have a… reputation. And these plants have a function that simulates… that reputation. They are here so I can try to be more comfortable around pre-humans.” 

So these plants have properties of both plants and meat? Not only that, they have traits that seem unique among humans. These would be excellent to integrate, as it would get me closer to understanding these meat aliens better, especially humans like Tobias.

“What makes them so unique? They all seem to be various sizes and shapes that I can't discern a difference between. They give off somewhat similar pheromones, but that's it.”

“These plants…” their voice trails off for a moment “These plants are…”

I focus intently, curiosity filling every last drop of sap in me.

“They are-” The word they use isn't interpreted by the translator, so it instead gives me a rather long explanation I don't quite understand. However, I do catch that word Vimja had demonstrated for me.

“I'm sorry, I should've expected this. The word you used must relate to meat, so my translator doesn't quite understand how to define it. All I could understand was that it was related to that eating thing.”

The vines on the botanist twist and roll over each other, refusing to settle in one spot.

“So you are at least familiar with the concept?”

“Slightly. I've been treating it as a similar process to how we share nutrition where I'm from. Of course, lacking a root system of your own I've opted to give directly from my vine. Well, the attached ones. Looking back I'm not sure that was the correct choice…”

They make an odd windy sound “Well, at least it's a start…”

They head to a nearby shelf and pick up a bag of small clumps of some sort.

“These plants do eat.”

They take out one of the small clear clumps and place it in the vines of the sap-covered one. Its vines wrap around it, covering it in sap. The botanists rapidly contract and relax their vines in response.

“I don't suppose they eat those clear clumps in nature?”

“N-no… They do not. They typically eat… m-meat…”

“They take their nutrients from meat. Is that the trait they share with humans?”

“That's a way to put it, yes.”

I watch the plant as it wraps around the clear clumps. This plant was access to the world of meat, a world wholly unknown to me. Not even just me, but my entire planet! I reach a vine into the soil where it sits.

“Are you going to do the integration thing with that pre-...plant?”

I stop just as I breach the soil surface.

“Should I not?”

They are quiet and still for a long time. I can easily assume a furious internal debate is going on inside their mind. 

“This one is called a Sundew.”

Eventually, they take a step back and stay quiet. I'm not sure how to take that, but curiosity draws me forward.

I extend a haustorium into the soil and search around for the root system. After I find it, I attempt a connection. 

This is unlike anything from before.

This was a process I've done countless times. Hundreds of plants. Dozens of species. Each gave similar sensations to each other with minimal differences. This is beyond anything I've felt before.

As I connect, there's a sensation of… “Want” is the wrong word. The Sundew can sense the comparably vast amount of nutrients and was immediately trying to root to me.

I slowly attempt to connect, ready to abort should there be a reaction to the alien biology of the exotic plant. However, as I go, I find this much easier than plants I'm familiar with. Perhaps they simply lack systems to avoid this type of root connection?

As the Sundew’s roots are firmly attached to my haustoria, I retract the vine back to its original position. The Sundew provides such an odd feeling. I can't help but be very aware of the positions of its vines, which ones are contracted and which ones are relaxed.

The botanist continues to watch as I finalize the integration process. Their vines have frozen completely,  and the orifice on their head hangs open slightly.

“So, it's connected to you know?”

“Yes, we now share nutrition.”

They return to silence, their eyes seem to focus past the walls.

“Do you… d-do you feel… [a biological desire to eat]?”

I consider the plant now attached to the vine on my side. I don't think it feels any different than any other plant I've had. Other than the unusually sensitive vines, all seems normal.

“As far as I can tell, it feels no different than any other plant.”

“This… This is a lot to take in.”

“You seemed wary of these plants and humans, is the eating of meat that unusual?”

“I- You see it more that- what you have to understand is- I think Dr.Sawyer or Captain Vimja would be better to answer that.”

“Ah, since you mentioned it, did they ever respond to you?”

“What do you me-”

Their whole head turns a bright purple.

“I will get them right away!”

They leave in a rush. I sort of didn't want them to, I had many questions I never had a chance to ask.

Well, I can get used to the Sundew while I wait. I put one of the clear clumps onto its sap-covered vines and feel it wrap around it.

So I had a customer call me requesting some sort of power cycling receptacles for their parking lot peds apparently due to the amount of EVs being plugged in drawing way to much power compared to their rental rates (parking peds are intended to use for plugging in a vehicle block heater in the winter), not trying to get into a debate of the morality of trying to find a solution for the property owner vs the residents but here we are.   On the past I had installed a IPLC receptacle that was supposed to save power but that worked based on temperature and time delays, but I don't think this is quite the solution they are looking for. 

Has anyone else installed any type of system to cycle power to parking lot peds while still allowing for efficient enough use for harsh winters and plugging in vehicle block heaters overnight?

psychopath,1fgomnr,Psychopath’s response to legal issues,"I need to get a type of restraining order on a psychopath I know to protect myself from him. I am afraid that giving the person the legal side of saying “no” will exasperate his need to feel control, i am really scared of his retaliation. he is one of the most need-to-be-in-control people i’ve ever met. he isn’t ashamed of stalking people through social media or through 3rd parties, ive seen him do It. he’ll do anything to keep an eye on a person still, he’s a gambler and loves risk. He would definitely risk breaking no contact because he wants to see if I’ll submit to him and give him control, because then having the power in that taboo situation would probably feel really good for someone like him. Like when you know you’re not supposed to talk to someone it makes it significantly more interesting to these kinds of people. 


What I need to figure it out is if the type of restraining order I’m getting will either scare him off, or invigorate his feelings of control//gambling more. 

He’s very sneaky, callous, etc. Hates authority, hates not being in control. 

i really like him like i loveeeee him, which is why I am doing this to myself because i know he manipulated me and played a character when we were close, and who he has been showing me he is now is in fact who who is, but as a person who has stockholm with another psychopath, (which i understand is up for debate, but i think i am  actually an example of it) and i understand my inability to get away from these people before its too late. my first ex tried to kill me cause idk he was bored? i would continuously go back to him until the restraining order which keeps him away for me, but especially me away from him. i dont want to conflate or confuse my feelings for these situations, but i would say these 2 boys are equally dangerous, both offending in their past as teenagers. Boy #2, the one that’s in my life now, i have a very scary idea of dangerous he could be. it’s so upsetting because he and i were very close and i don’t know how much of it was real. he would tell me things i know he never told anyone else and i would never judge him for it, that’s why he liked me. he knows a lot about me and he has been purposefully trying to affect me a lot lately. i used to spam text him, well more than he would text me, and he would answer, but now I am the one who has had him on delivered because of stuff that he’s done. i can sort of feel him panicking, if that makes sense, like because i know how he is he’s just sort of thinking “okay, she just needs time right now, and she’ll come back. that’s how these things work, i win.” he’s been more threatening and controlling with me than ever, and i need to get away. i don’t know if i have the capability to not be near him, to not answer him, and i also know the only thing that will hurt him or affect him in anyway, is to take away his control and ability to contact me. He’s recently gotten addicted to certain drugs and he’s just gone off the deep end since. i want nothing to do with it but i want him to know i am done and that he cannot talk to me. this is a person i thought was gonna be in my life forever after we met and became close but i understand people like you struggle to maintain real relationships. initially our relationship was based on mutual interest, attraction, trust, we bonded really highly and he made a really strong effort to be good to me. that’s all gone now so im done, but i cannot forgive him because he will just do the same shit over and over again.

biology,1fgoj5u,Heredity vs genetic make-up,"Hello everyone,

I am currently studying for my developmental psychology class and came across a piece of text that I can't really decipher. It was just nestled in part of the Nature vs Nurture debate.

It says: 
Heredity does not equal genetic condition/disposition. A trait can very much be genetically influenced  without being hereditary. Example: A set of two eyes.
Heredity presupposes differences in individuals.
‐------

I have great trouble understanding how a set of two eyes is not part of hereditary make-up? 
I assume I am confounding the two terms genetic and hereditary make-up, but I have trouble understanding the exact differences?

Is genetic make-up = The whole DNA, including all polymorphisms 

Hereditary make-up = Only information of the polymorphism of a certain trait that was passed on?

Is that it? 
I genuinely wish terms where explained peoperly in class.

SouthAsianMasculinity,1fgoibs,The Definitive Discussion on Dating. ,"Aight, Brothers of this subreddit, today we settle the score on this topic once and for all. Mods if its possible can yall pin this post. 

  
Dont get it twisted, most men of all backgrounds struggle with getting girls. This is not a secret, if yall look around then its clear to see that. Now when it comes to advice that's available online. There is two factors at play here:

# 1. The value of self-improvement advice is overrated.

Here we go, I said it, Most people expect too much from advice to help them. If there was genuinely some advice that existed that would instantly improve your relationship with women, the person that delivers that advice would be the greatest philosopher of all time. No debates. Its time for yall to stop looking for that secret advice. If you look at reality for what it is and are honest to yourself, then you already know what it is that you are supposed to be doing. Nobody is going to hold your hand through this cause nobody really cares about you. yall got to do this by yourself. 



# 2. There are nuances at play on navigating the dating space, where problems that desi community typically face that go beyond basic self improvement.

Thats what I hope this post could be. What are some key information that yall have discovered that is unique to the desi experience that would greatly benefit everybody here to know. lets talk about it. 

  
here is my advice: 

  
There is an element of a Crabs in the bucket mentality in the community and that exist in every community but you got to recognize it and be aware of it. Misery loves company. If it appears that some of your so called ""friends"" are a bit too eager to hear about your problems and a bit too dismissive of your successes than you may need to consider weather its worth having them around. On the same note, do not be a crab either. if some of your homeboys are doing well in life, then be happy for them. I feel like a generation that grew up on hearing about Sharma ji ke beta and beti have got some yall convinced that if yall cant be happy then nobody should be. Sometime you could be doing the right thing, but your group dont like that so they try to make go back to your old ways so that they can be comfortable, gotta be aware of that.",CommonAirline4452,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1fgoibs/the_definitive_discussion_on_dating/,/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1fgoibs/the_definitive_discussion_on_dating/,2,2024-09-14 15:21:51,1,,False,0.67,Advice/Ideas/Discussion,2024-09-14 12:18:55.069759

The past few years have been really dull for me because I was either at the hospital slaving  (I'm a dentist) or at the gym fighting my demons. I could rarely socialize with how hectic my course was.

However, I just completed a big part of my life and I am really in the mood of making new friends and also, maybe watching a movie or show together! 

I'd love to know more about you. Maybe open the message with your story. Whatever it is. 

Here's how I look:

I'm 6 feet, I have dark brown eyes, short wavy black hair with brown streaks, I'm pretty athletic in my build, broad shoulders, long legs. My aesthetic constantly oscillates between nerd and stripper – think smart jeans and a well-fitted shirt for everyday wear, but I clean up nicely for a night out or a special occasion.

Interests:

🖋 I'm an author and a poet. I like keeping things, ideas and people immortal in my work. I'd like to think of myself as a hope collector, who likes to collect abandoned hope, repurpose it, and make it into something you would want to have in your life.  

👟 I'm really passionate about the environment. I love guerilla gardening, and being a rebel against the capitalist systems. I'm always open to having a healthy discussion/debate even on things I don't agree upon. 

🍮 I love cooking! I'm always looking forward to learning new cuisines! I also like to grow most of my ingredients. I'd say food is one of my love languages! 

⭐ I really like anime, I've had this weird generational habit of collecting different rocks (Rockhounding), I hit the gym everyday, I try to be spiritual, and read. One of my recent obsessions has been chess! I'm also fascinated by history and art.

🏳️‍🌈 I'm bisexual and an LGBT ally! I've been in the worst depression and I've made it out. Here to give away all my love. ❤️


What I’m Looking For:

I’m actively seeking people who are open-minded, adventurous, and have a positive outlook on life! :D Someone who can enjoy both the simple detours and the grand roadtrips. If you love impromptu plans, deep conversations, and laughter until it hurts, we’ll get along just fine.

NorthCarolina,1fgohyx,NC Superintendent of Public Instruction debate 9/14 discussion ,"I’m watching live and I’m interested in others’ thoughts and reactions.

One of the most revealing questions the moderator asked was near the end, about research showing the resegregation of schools in NC. Morrow answered first and basically said that it’s a parent choice to seek the best school for education and safety. I thought that answer lacked understanding of and respect for the history of desegregation in WCPSS. Does she think that parents of all races wouldn’t choose safe, effective schools for their children?

OMG, it’s closing statements now and she’s talking about masturbation 😂😂😂

childfree,1fgoh86,How to deal with a stubborn friend ,"Hi folks,
I[22M] have had a CF ideology for a long time and it has only become more strong in last few years. I am also a closet Asexual, but I have been quite vocal about my CF and antinatal ideas with my friends. 

Now I have this really stubborn and irritating friend in my circle, to whom I have explained my reasons of being CF many times now and yet he always tells me something like its a phase or you will change or some bs like that. And mind you, its always him that steers conversation along these lines, coz I have no interest in telling him the same god damn thing for the nth time. This guy is really getting on my nerves now and I just don't know how to deal with it.
 
And its not just with these conversations or even just me, if anyone in my circle is saying about anything about there life, this guy always has to give his advice. And he always gives his opinions like he knows everything and our opinions are wrong/doesn't matter coz he is right. Guy won't even try to understand someone else's pov and yet always tries to debate about things with others.

I am really at a boiling point now and have been avoiding conversations like these with him for past few months but whenever we meet up he just somehow brings up the conversations along these lines and I m just sick of it.

PasswordManagers,1fgoh6n,Why so much conflict between open source and non open source software ,"I just came across a debate between people with different opinions on open-sourcing a password manager.

The other side believes that open-sourcing enhances security, allows for customization, and offers free access to the software.

Gifted,1fgof0y,Where Does The Smart Alcoholic Come From?,"This is a genuine question about making poor decisions over time that culminate in disastrous results. While alcoholism isn't the only outcome I am interested in the nature of it currently makes it a good example. In order to acquire alcoholism in this discussion we accept that you must choose to repeatedly drink alcohol over a period of time and rationalize the drinking of alcohol.

There are four hurdles to alcoholism which I don't understand how they fail:

1. For most people, in most cases, it tastes bad.

2. For most people, in most cases, it makes you physically ill.

3. The body of knowledge humans have on alcoholism is very large and it is never found to be a net positive state.

4. [Alcohol itself has fallen out of social favor in many places as a trend.](https://www.independent.co.uk/business/young-people-biggest-consumers-of-low-and-noalcohol-drinks-survey-b2472403.html)

If you can explain at this point, feel free, I will expound below.

Expanding 1 & 2: Alcohol has a natural reaction in the physical body for most people that is unpleasant starting at the tongue. The greater the alcoholic content the more it burns, the worse it tastes, and in general the greater the obvious warning signs that this is not a good source of nutrients. In many cases with high proof drinks you can tell right away that this is not meant to be drank by humans. Further, in many cases, esp. for those who are new to the substance it will make you physically ill and can be found to create spells of dizziness, nausea, vertigo and other such obvious effects as well as less obvious ones such as difficulty thinking and making decisions or having impulsive behaviors which are regretted once one comes to. 

Expanding 3: Alcoholism has been documented very well in medical literature and failing to come across any form of training regarding alcohol effects is almost impossible as it is taught even in public school systems. The amount of information available on the effects that is very easily acquired is very high and the number of studies that are public are also equally high therefore there is no room for debate on the matter. No one claims that alcoholism is some kind of conspiracy theory. No one claims that alcoholism is a treatment for depression or any other mental illness. There is a 100% consensus that alcohol does not have any particularly meaningful positive effects that cannot be acquired from another source that is significantly less harmful.

Expanding 4: Group effects and social effects are real, however they are waning in support of alcohol consumption. I wouldn't pose that there is no element by which a person feels compelled to drink alcohol such as at a wedding with a champagne however the effect of a single class once every few years at a major occasion does not form alcoholism so even if we pose that alcohol consumption is required at times as part of the social fabric, which is disappearing anyway, peer pressure effects in local spaces is not sufficient as an explanation. 

Questions:

1. Given an average person cannot enter into a state of ignorance regarding alcohol due to the knowledge being everywhere this makes the choice to pursue alcoholism purposeful. What drives a person to make that choice?

2. Given that this substance typically is rejected by the body even if one were to be confused on the matter and have no education, outside of peer effects, why would a person continue to pursue a substance that creates a genuine feeling of illness?

There are no wrong answers.

PresidentialElection,1fgodbm,Kamala surprised me ,"On the September 10th debate I was honestly kind of shocked by Kamala's performance. At her rallys and speeches previous to the debate. She kind of seemed  off? A lot of her speeches contain ""poking"" at trump and his policys. Kinda saying ""Were better. Vote for me'"". I'm not trying to say she didn't explain her policys or her views on certain things. She did and she did what was expected to do. Simply explain to her supporters what she has planned and what can happen if she gets into office. Besides the point, her rallys were pretty much on par with what we expected. Back to the debate. It seems like she saved and planned everything very well for the debate. She kept her composure *with some exceptions*, stated the differences between her and Trump's policy's, She directed mostly everything she said to us the people. It's was a very solid performance for Kamala. I hope there's a second debate so we can see if shes consistent.

Wellbutrin_Bupropion,1fgobk0,How long to wait until deciding the medication just isn’t working well for you? ,"Main question at the bottom if you want to skip how I got myself into this mess. 

I’m in a bit of a weird situation. I took Wellbutrin with an SSRI around 10 years ago and felt that it worked well. Upon hitting a rough patch, I figured I’d try Wellbutrin again. I scheduled a telehealth appt with one of those sites where you don’t even need to speak to a provider. Requested Wellbutrin and was prescribed SR 100mg 2x per day. 

I have been taking it for 3 weeks and my depression symptoms have improved. However, the amount of anxiety I am having is really hard to handle. I am in a new area and can’t get in with a primary care doctor until the end of Oct. I found a site that lets you talk to a psychiatrist and I am waiting to hear back from them about scheduling. 

I thought I knew myself well enough to go about this journey with no oversight. And apparently I was wrong. I wanted to avoid an SSRI because they have historically given me sexual side effects. But now I’m realizing that maybe the SSRI was needed for balance. 

I have an older prescription for buspar that a previous provider gave me that I have debated on taking. But I think I am in over my head at this point and shouldn’t make it worse by mixing meds. I am lucky to have a PRN Xanax script which has helped a little. But I don’t want to rely on this everyday. 

I *think* the anxiety is better than it was last week. And definitely better than the week before. But it’s still bad. And I feel like shit. Which was the opposite effect I was going for by taking a medication. 

So my main question: how long should I give this before I decide that this medication just isn’t for me and try to taper off? 

Any other advice or suggestions are welcome. I know I am in over my head and not establishing a primary care prior to this was a bad idea. But here I am.

Cooking,1fgo4r6,Kid Friendly Sushi Bowl Sauce,"First off, you guys were amazing when it came to potluck question so let me dive into another one 

My kids are the pickiest.  It's difficult for me since I've eaten everything since I was a kid.  Seriously, my documented two favorite foods when asked in kindergarten were 1. Kalamary (calamari) and 2. Toemaytoes (tomatoes).  My kids ..not so much.

My newly minted 10 year old is falling in love with Japanese culture and wants to ""try"" new things.  So on his birthday last weekend we went to a One Piece themed sushi place, which was terrible.  But, he tried a simple cucumber maki (the boy loves his cucumbers) and was disappointed that the rice was dry and couldn't get past the chewiness of the nori.

So, I'm going to try sushi Bowls at home to strike while the iron is...slightly above room temp.  My husband and I will have some very nice, but not sushi grade, cooked salmon and the kids will have fish sticks, cucumbers, rice, furikake, maybe quick pickled carrots....

Believe it or not, my kids hate rice.  I know, how do you hate rice?  But the boy was...ok...with it quote: ""I mean, I guess it depends what's on it...?""

So I come to you, cooks of Reddit, what kind of sauce can I put on the rice in this sushi-esque bowl?

Things he won't try:
1.Barbecue sauce (I know, I'm debating teriyaki in my head already)

2. Spicy (One time he said a Caesar salad was too spicy because it had black pepper in it)

MinecraftServer,1fgo4qb,Anyone play Minecraft Bedrock on here?,"Hey!

I’m a 36M who runs a dedicated Bedrock server called **BlockQuest**. I know, I know—Java and cross-platform servers are awesome, and they’re everywhere! But honestly, there’s something about the quirky charm of Bedrock Edition that just *clicks* for me—trident killers, funky redstone mechanics, the whole deal. It's like Bedrock has its own personality!

But let’s be real—lag can be a huge issue on Bedrock. It’s the one downside that makes you question your life choices when more than 10 players hop on. After testing just about every hosting service out there (seriously, I've been through them all), we still couldn’t shake that pesky lag.

So, what did I do? Well, I went a little overboard and built a completely dedicated server just for Bedrock. Crazy? Maybe. Worth it? Absolutely. Now, we’re rocking with 10+ players online and zero lag! 🎉

If you're an adult Bedrock player who loves the game’s quirks and wants a lag-free survival experience, come join the fun! And hey, if you’re on Team Java and think it’s better, I’m all ears for a good debate. 😄

HerbalBloom,1fgo4e6,Deviated Septum Challenges: Effective Solutions for Better Breathing,"A deviated septum (DS) refers to an abnormal displacement of the nasal septum, the cartilage and bone structure that separates the nasal cavities. This condition is prevalent, with studies estimating that up to 80% of the population may have some degree of septal deviation, though many are asymptomatic. For those who do experience symptoms, a deviated septum can lead to significant nasal obstruction, affecting overall quality of life (QoL). Common symptoms include difficulty breathing through the nose, frequent sinus infections, and sleep disturbances. This article explores the psychiatric implications associated with chronic sinonasal disorders, treatment perspectives from otolaryngologists, and the effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical management strategies.

Recent research has revealed a concerning relationship between chronic sinonasal diseases, such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and septal deviation, and mental health disorders. A study highlighted that patients suffering from these conditions exhibit a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression compared to the general population. Specifically, the study found that anxiety and depression scores, measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), were significantly correlated with the severity of nasal symptoms. This underscores the importance of addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of treatment in patients with deviated septum and related conditions (Giombi et al., 2024).

# The Psychiatric Burden of Chronic Sinonasal Diseases

Chronic sinonasal diseases, including CRS and septal deviation, are not only associated with physical symptoms but also a substantial psychiatric burden. According to a recent observational study, approximately 25% to 28% of patients with CRS experience depression, while a meta-analysis indicated a similar trend among those with septal deviation (Giombi et al., 2024). The psychological impact is particularly pronounced in younger patients, who reported higher anxiety and depression levels compared to older individuals. This finding suggests that the distress caused by chronic nasal symptoms may be more acutely felt in younger patients, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

The study further revealed that the quality of life (QoL) of patients with sinonasal disorders is significantly impaired due to their mental health status. The inverse relationship between age and anxiety/depression scores points to the necessity of integrating mental health evaluations into the treatment plans for patients with chronic sinonasal diseases. By recognizing the psychological dimensions of these conditions, healthcare providers can adopt a more holistic approach, which could lead to better patient outcomes (Giombi et al., 2024).

# Surgical Management: Perspectives on Septoplasty

Septoplasty is a common surgical intervention aimed at correcting a deviated septum to alleviate nasal obstruction and improve airflow. However, the use of postoperative nasal packing, particularly non-absorbable packs, remains a contentious issue among otolaryngologists. A recent survey conducted among otolaryngologists in Kuwait found that while a majority routinely perform septoplasty, there is a varied consensus on the necessity of nasal packing postoperatively. Some practitioners advocate for its use to prevent complications like bleeding and hematoma formation, while others argue that the associated discomfort and pain may outweigh the benefits (Alghanem et al., 2024).

Alternatives to nasal packing, such as quilting sutures, are gaining traction among surgeons who seek to minimize patient discomfort without compromising surgical outcomes. The survey revealed that 66% of respondents believed that quilting sutures could effectively replace nasal packing, further emphasizing the need for evidence-based guidelines that address postoperative care. This shift towards less invasive approaches could enhance patient comfort and satisfaction, aligning with the trend towards personalized medicine in otolaryngology (Alghanem et al., 2024).

# Comparing Surgical and Non-Surgical Management Options

The effectiveness of septoplasty versus non-surgical management for a deviated septum has been a subject of research interest. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicated that patients undergoing septoplasty experienced significant improvements in nasal obstruction symptoms compared to those receiving non-surgical management, such as nasal steroids or decongestants. The findings showed that septoplasty led to enhanced scores on the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale and improved quality of life after six and twelve months post-treatment (Zhou et al., 2024).

However, it is essential to note that while septoplasty is effective, it carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and the potential for revision surgery. Long-term complications were more prevalent in patients who underwent septoplasty alone compared to those who also had concurrent turbinoplasty, which suggests that combined surgical interventions may provide better outcomes in terms of symptom relief and complication rates. This highlights the importance of a thorough preoperative assessment to tailor the surgical approach to the individual patient’s needs (Zhou et al., 2024).

# The Role of Nasal Dilators in Managing Deviated Septum and Sleep Disorders

Nasal dilators, including internal devices like NoZovent and external products such as Breathe Right Strips, have been explored as potential adjuncts for improving nasal airflow and addressing symptoms associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring. While these devices may enhance nasal breathing and provide subjective relief for some patients, recent systematic reviews indicate that they do not significantly improve key clinical outcomes related to OSA.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating these nasal dilators found that, although there was a slight reduction in the apnea index (AI) when using internal nasal dilators, overall improvements in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were not statistically significant. Specifically, the AI decreased by approximately 4.87 events per hour with internal nasal dilators, while external nasal dilators showed minimal change. This suggests that while nasal dilators can aid in alleviating nasal obstruction, they should not be viewed as a primary treatment for OSA (Djupesland et al., 2016).

The use of nasal dilators may still hold therapeutic value in specific contexts. For instance, they could facilitate easier breathing for patients using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, potentially allowing for lower pressure settings that enhance patient comfort and compliance. Furthermore, in cases where nasal dilators significantly improve breathing but patients cannot tolerate standard CPAP therapy, surgical options may be explored as adjunctive treatments to improve nasal airflow and overall respiratory function (Djupesland et al., 2016).

In summary, while nasal dilators can improve nasal airflow and provide some symptomatic relief, their role in managing obstructive sleep apnea and related conditions remains limited. They should be considered supplementary to more comprehensive treatment strategies, particularly in cases with a deviated septum or chronic sinonasal issues.

# Dietary Considerations and Their Influence on Symptoms

Emerging evidence suggests that dietary factors may play a role in exacerbating symptoms associated with a deviated septum and chronic rhinosinusitis. A systematic review examining the impact of naturally occurring food chemical components found that specific diets, such as low-histamine and low-salicylate diets, could alleviate symptoms in patients with chronic urticaria and sinonasal diseases. Eliminating these dietary components appears to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory symptoms, providing a non-pharmacological avenue to manage sinonasal conditions (Meyer et al., 2024).

The relationship between food chemical sensitivities and sinonasal symptoms underscores the need for a comprehensive management approach that includes dietary interventions. Further research is warranted to establish standardized elimination diets and their effects on symptom improvement in patients with chronic sinonasal diseases. By integrating dietary considerations into treatment plans, healthcare providers can offer patients additional strategies to manage their symptoms effectively (Meyer et al., 2024).

– Monitoring and Adjustment: Regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the effectiveness of the herbal formula and make any needed adjustments. Mental health status and nasal obstruction symptoms should be periodically evaluated using standardized scales.

# Conclusion

The management of a deviated septum extends beyond mere anatomical correction; it encompasses a holistic approach that addresses both physical and psychological health. This article highlights the multifaceted nature of septal deviation, emphasizing its prevalence and the significant impact it can have on quality of life through symptoms such as nasal obstruction, sleep disturbances, and heightened susceptibility to mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. Recent studies underscore the importance of integrating mental health evaluations into treatment plans, particularly for younger patients who may experience more pronounced psychological distress.

Surgical interventions, particularly septoplasty, are commonly employed to alleviate symptoms associated with deviated septum. However, the necessity and effectiveness of postoperative practices, such as nasal packing, remain debated among otolaryngologists. The exploration of alternatives like quilting sutures presents an opportunity to enhance patient comfort while maintaining surgical efficacy. Additionally, the potential role of nasal dilators, though limited, may offer temporary relief for some patients, particularly as adjuncts to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.

Furthermore, dietary considerations may play a crucial role in managing sinonasal symptoms, with evidence supporting the benefits of low-histamine and low-salicylate diets for patients experiencing chronic rhinosinusitis and related conditions. As research continues to evolve, it is essential to adopt a multidisciplinary and personalized approach in managing deviated septum and its associated complications. By recognizing the interplay between physical symptoms, psychological well-being, surgical options, and dietary influences, healthcare providers can optimize treatment strategies and improve overall patient outcomes, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for those affected by this common yet complex condition.

KamalaHarris,1fgo3e7,What’s the best way forward for Kamala’s campaign?,"The debate was an unquestionable win.

The ABC interview after that garnered more mixed views.

It’s nowhere near as bad as republicans are painting it out to be (I saw their commentary before I saw the interview, expected much worse)

Their bar is sky high for Kamala, but literally non-existent for Trump. Main thing they had against her was her lack of clear policies. 

But that line fell out the window when their candidate, who had FOUR (4) years to prepare said he had “concepts of a plan” for healthcare, no inflation plan, no childcare cost plan. But immigrants are eating dogs and geese though.

It’s very obvious to me the fearmongering on their end will increase as the election comes close.

I’m just wondering how Kamala and her team should move going forward. 

More interviews? Adversarial ones? She will definitely need to step away from the politician, canned speeches if that’s the case. 

Walz does that very well: repeats similar points, but switches it up often and keeps it natural (vs feeling rehearsed). Buttigieg too, he repeats himself a lot but people seem to have less of an issue with it because he’s more confident imo, looks interviewers in the eyes, less hesitant in choosing words etc.

the_everything_bubble,1fgpfoq,Trump is no longer trying to win the election,"
The word is out.  Trump is no longer trying to win the election.

It’s very obvious now that Trump is not trying to win the election.

Why else would he go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things he did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let’s be honest.  Trump wants to lose.  Why else would he go on a the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

 He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Why else would he go on a debate stage and refuse to support Poland against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine?

He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Trump knows he’s going to lose but he is using his air time to make a push for another run in the entertainment industry.  Trump will be a consultant in a movie about his political career.

He won’t play himself.  Instead the role of Trump will go to Ric Flair, the ex-professional wrestler known as the “dirtiest wrestler” in the game.

Flair was very popular for his bleached blond hair and carnival barking style.  Thousands of wrestling fans believed his act was real and they adored him much like Trump supporters adore Trump.

Dolly Parton is being courted to star as Stormy Daniels, the American pornographic film actress and former stripper.

Trump’s extras in the movie will be picked in a pecking order with the first opportunities going to the “patriots” who attacked the Capitol.

The secondary roles will go to former MAGAs who were not part of the attack but supported MAGA.

MAGA movie extra hopefuls will have to bring a red MAGA cap to be considered as an extra for the movie: “Trump. He did it his Way.”",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,2,2024-09-14 16:02:47,4,,False,1.0,POLITICS,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609
DeltaFoxtrot,1fgpefq,From Russia With Love,"In a discussion with RAND experts John F. Tefft and William Courtney, several key issues related to U.S. policy towards Russia were explored, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, cybersecurity threats, economic sanctions, and the future of arms control. Both experts highlighted the complexities that the next U.S. president will face in navigating Russia's aggression and its global implications. Tefft, a former U.S. ambassador to several countries including Russia and Ukraine, and Courtney, who has a background in arms control and U.S.-Russia relations, offer their perspectives on how the U.S. can address these challenges.

One of the primary foreign policy challenges identified by Tefft is the need to resist Russia's aggression in Ukraine and continue supporting Ukraine's military and economic efforts. Both experts agree that U.S. efforts must be sustained to prevent Russia from succeeding in its war of attrition. In addition to the immediate threat posed by Russia, Tefft emphasized the importance of maintaining NATO's unity and addressing long-term challenges like nuclear arms control, emerging technologies, and potential political changes in Russia.

Courtney pointed out that the U.S. must also confront Russia while finding ways to cooperate in areas of mutual interest, such as climate change and the International Space Station. The U.S. faces the challenge of balancing military support for Ukraine with broader geopolitical concerns, including bolstering NATO forces and maintaining a stable nuclear arms balance as the New START Treaty nears expiration.

Regarding the war in Ukraine, both experts believe that continued U.S. support is essential. Tefft suggests that the U.S. should exhibit strategic patience, similar to its approach during the Cold War, while Courtney advocates for raising the costs of Russia's aggression, drawing parallels to the U.S. strategy during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

In the realm of cybersecurity, Tefft and Courtney underscore the growing threat posed by Russian cyberattacks. They emphasize the need for the U.S. to bolster defenses and increase collaboration between the public and private sectors. Sanctions and accountability measures for bad actors will be key to addressing these threats.

When it comes to Russian interference in U.S. elections, both experts argue for a strong response. Tefft suggests implementing new sanctions, while Courtney points to the need for both overt and covert measures to deter future interference, drawing on lessons from the 2016 election.

The economic sanctions imposed on Russia have had a significant impact, though Tefft acknowledges that Russia has been able to evade some of them. Both experts agree that sanctions are a long-term tool and that continued refinement is needed to tighten the screws on Russia's war economy. Courtney highlights the growing economic pressures within Russia, such as capital flight and inflation, which are signs of a deteriorating economy.

The future of arms control is uncertain, with both experts expressing doubts about the renewal of the New START Treaty. Tefft and Courtney see little hope for new agreements while Russia wages war in Ukraine, and both suggest that any new treaty would likely need to include China, given its growing nuclear capabilities.

Lastly, the experts agree that change will eventually come to Russia, possibly driven by internal pressures from economic, demographic, and political factors. Tefft and Courtney suggest that the U.S. must be prepared for potential shifts in Russian leadership, similar to the liberalizing changes seen under Mikhail Gorbachev. Such changes could open the door for new arms control agreements and a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.",boutoille,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaFoxtrot/comments/1fgpefq/from_russia_with_love/,/r/DeltaFoxtrot/comments/1fgpefq/from_russia_with_love/,0,2024-09-14 16:01:15,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

""The party has 309 seats in the House of Representatives after the elections, which means that we, the Conscience faction, can definitely prevent any legislation from this administration if we remain united. We must not forget what is at stake—the legacy of Merriam, the identity of the party, the freedom of the nation. They can say whatever they want; we know it's not true—Miles wouldn't have agreed to that. He fought for democracy, not against it. Like us, he would fight for the Six Arrows if he were alive today. We must not take the pressure off their necks for a second. At any moment, the mighty fist that is the power of America will be placed upon them.""

""So, are we really going for it? A bloody fight in Congress and the streets against them?""

""Oh, most definitely yes. We're bringing out the heavy guns for this. The bloodbath must end. We'll prevent their legislation, push for impeachment, pass laws against the Legion, enforce the laws in the states where we still have governors. Most Americans are against this BS—and even then, they don't know the full severity of Stelle's damage and corruption to the nation.""

""It's just surprising that you’re coming out so strong against the president from your own party, becoming such a loud voice in recent months. I thought you Federalists had an internal unity that the other parties could only envy.""

""That was when we were united under the fundamental principles that Merriam laid out. But when they dared to abolish the Arrows, they broke the rules of the game. This is it. I will not give them a moment of rest. The Grant years were devastating for America. The Findlay Massacre and the Twilight Purge... I owe it to this country to prevent something like that from ever happening again.""

""Well, after the conference in Nashville, I'm sure the other parties in the opposition think like you. The Atlantic Union, the Solidarists, Popular Front, even Prohibition—all of them. They smell blood in the water.""

""Good. Because we're going to need them. It's not just about fighting in Congress, but out on the streets. The Blueshirts and their militias won’t back down easily, but neither will we. Our paramilitary wings are getting stronger by the day. I also appealed to friends in the armed forces and the police to support us, make sure the other parties do the same. I was one of the main supporters of passing the bill for universal military training, there are enough supporters of the constitution and those who remembered what we fought for during the War across the American population, no matter what Stelle thinks. We're ready to take them on, step by step.""

""And you're willing to align with groups that just a year ago, you would never have stood beside?""

""Desperate times. Besides, we've made compromises before. The Popular Front may have their own agenda, but their hatred of Stelle runs as deep as ours. If we can work together to drive this administration into the ground, then we will. But make no mistake, it won't be pretty.""

""How far are you willing to go?""

""As far as it takes. They want to play dirty—well, we know how to fight too. We’ll shut down every bill they try to pass, tie them up in committee, filibuster their agenda into oblivion. I have already started investigations regarding impeachment. And on the streets? We’re going to organize like they’ve never seen. The time for niceties is over. This is war, plain and simple. I'll let you on a little secret, many of Stelle's most ardent supports in the party got purged in an internal scandal.""

""I have to admit, I didn’t expect you to turn into the face of this. But after the midterms, you’re becoming more of a figurehead for the opposition than I expected.""

""Someone had to step up. Stelle and his cronies are dragging the country into the dirt, and no one else was willing to call it what it is; treason against the Republic. I swear to God I won’t rest until we’ve taken them down. This is about the future of America, and I’ll be damned if we let another dictator rise.""

""Do you think this is really going to resonate with the public? Most of them are tired of the chaos, the street clashes, the paramilitaries. They want peace, stability, not another civil conflict.""

""That's exactly why we need to be the ones to offer a clear, uncompromising vision for the future. We need to remind them of what’s at stake: the values of 1912, the Constitution, the rule of law. We aren't just fighting to remove a corrupt administration, we're fighting for the soul of this country. And if it means allying with the Popular Front, the Solidarists or even these prohibition boys, to stop Stelle and his Legion from dragging us into the abyss, then so be it. The stakes are too high to play it safe now.""

""And you think the coalition will hold?""

""It has to. We’re in this together now. If we falter, Stelle and his regime will consolidate their power. The next few months will be crucial. We fight. With everything we’ve got.""",Artistic_Victory,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fgpbu5/guardians_of_the_republic_a_house_divided/,/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fgpbu5/guardians_of_the_republic_a_house_divided/,1,2024-09-14 15:58:27,4,,False,1.0,Alternate Election Lore,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

It’s me due to the fact of simply rejecting the false electors submitted by Trump in hopes to overturn 2020 election is an incredibly pivotal point and significant avoids a huge constitutional crisis. I mean the who “rally” during Jan 6 was centered around applying pressure for Mike Pence to make the decision in favor of Trump. There’s no way to put it otherwise.

He as a republican from trump administration publicly “defying” Trump in name of the constitution is the idealism for American ideals.

Me personally I disagree and despise Pence heavily on policy, but that movement was more significant than any realize and in hindsight would benefit the core values of american democracy.

EndFPTP,1fgp4j6,Are there any (joke?) voting systems using tournament brackets?,"This is not a serious post, but this has been on my mind. I think it's pretty clear that if a voting system used a tournament bracket structure where you start out with (randomly) determined pairs whose loser is eliminated and winner is paired up with the winner from the neighboring pair, and where each match-up's winner is determined with ranked ballot pairwise wins, it would elect the Condorcet winner and be Smith compliant (I am pretty sure). If the brackets are known at the time of voting, strategic voting is going to be possible, and this method would probably fail many criteria. What happens, though, if the bracket is randomly generated after the voting has been completed? In essence this should be similar to Smith/Random ballot, but it doesn't *sound* like it. No one ""ballot"" would be responsible, psychologically, for the result. And because it would be a random ballot, it would also make many criteria inapplicable, because the tipping points are not voter-determined or caused by changes in the ballots, but unknowable and ungameable. It is, I believe, also extremely easy to explain.",ThroawayPeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/1fgp4j6/are_there_any_joke_voting_systems_using/,/r/EndFPTP/comments/1fgp4j6/are_there_any_joke_voting_systems_using/,1,2024-09-14 15:49:17,1,,False,1.0,Question,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

neoliberal,1fgp240,Arizona's 1864 abortion ban is officially off the books,"Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed the bill in May, declaring it was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona.

Emotions on the House floor and in the gallery ran high as House Democrats were able to garner the support of three Republicans to pass the repeal legislation two weeks later, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. Two GOP senators joined with Democrats a week later to grant final approval.

Democrats were advocating for the repeal long before the Supreme Court issued its ruling. Even Hobbs called for action in her January State of the State address.

With the territorial ban no longer in play, Arizona law allows abortions until 15 weeks. After that, there is an exception to save the life of the mother, but missing are exceptions for cases of rape or incest after the 15-week mark.

Voters will have the ultimate say on whether to add the right to an abortion to the state constitution when they cast their ballots in the general election.

If voters approve the measure, abortions would be allowed until fetal viability — the point at which a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks. It also would allow abortions after that time in cases where the mother’s physical or mental health is in jeopardy.",John3262005,https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-ban-repeal-ac4a1eb97efcd3c506aeaac8f8152127,/r/neoliberal/comments/1fgp240/arizonas_1864_abortion_ban_is_officially_off_the/,0,2024-09-14 15:46:21,11,,False,1.0,News (US),2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

AskALiberal,1fgoygt,Where do you see the Democratic and Republican parties headed in the next 50 years?,"#### The question
**Just as the title states, where do you see the US Democratic and Republican parties headed in the next 50 years?**

#### My (admittedly optimistic) take 
The GOP desperately attempts to hold on to power, doubling or tripling down on gerrymandering and other voter suppression tactics. As their base continues to dwindle, more and more people realize that their voice is being silenced. Opposition grows, and eventually the Democratic party is able to eliminate the filibuster. Shortly after, the Republican party no longer has enough of a base left to win elections, pass legislation, or even prevent Democrats from passing legislation.

At this point, one of two things will happen:

1. The Republican party abandons the ideals of maga, and shifts to the left. This would leave the Democratic party still struggling to find internal unity, but the same would occur in the Republican party, as far-right factions remained.
2. The Republican party fades into obscurity, and either  
..a. The Democratic party splits into a moderate party and a more progressive party  
..b. A more progressive party emerges as the second dominant party, perhaps the Working Families Party

Ideally, we get option 2, and the entirety of the US political system shifts to the left. Option one does allow the Republican party to shift left, but option two introduces a dominant party further left than current Democrats.

For the near term, I see Democrats putting further left goals such as universal basic income and universal healthcare being put on the table for at least a decade. The Democratic party will return to its roots: they will support unions heavily, they will enact much stronger antitrust legislation, and cut taxes for the average American, while raising taxes overall (primarily by raising taxes for the wealthy and large corporations). Once the Democratic party has convinced the American people that they can make economically sound and healthy decisions, they will begin to push for more fundamental changes.",Newparadime,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1fgoygt/where_do_you_see_the_democratic_and_republican/,/r/AskALiberal/comments/1fgoygt/where_do_you_see_the_democratic_and_republican/,2,2024-09-14 15:41:49,2,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

She’s still wagging her tail and eventually eager to take neighborhood walks, but we’re concerned she’s in pain. We’re giving her Tylenol on the advice of our vet. We understand that Tylenol is not a typical pain reliever for dogs, but we’re in palliative care and want her to enjoy her remaining time and be relatively pain free. 

My question is two-fold.  What other pain relief does this group recommend beyond Tylenol? And how can you objectively tell when a pup’s time is up? She doesn’t show us signs of pain and I’m concerned she’ll mask it for longer than I’d want her to suffer.

Also - any tips on keeping her better hydrated (electrolytes that are effective for dogs)? 

If you have criticisms of our choices on Tylenol or, frankly, anything else, take it easy on us. We’re still processing and we are trying our best to make decisions that are best for her.

PoliticalDiscussion,1fgokf7,"Do you think that prosecutorial discretion, as it is applied now, is a good thing?","The system of prosecutorial discretion is one where the prosecutor is given immense leeway on whether to take on a case or not. They are not completely free, but in most systems of common law (derived from Britain for the most part), they decide whether a prosecution is in the public interest and if there is sufficient evidence to take someone to trial.

The US is essentially unique these days in that prosecutors for the most part are elected, and the ones who aren't are usually substantially political appointments and not civil servants. Some others using common law are more like civil servants, although some of the high ups of the departments may have more politics in the appointment. 

Most countries using civil law such as the Netherlands do not use nearly so much leeway, although there are some policies the department may issue, such as those pertaining to drugs where there is a policy of not prosecuting the possession of cannabis up to five grams per person who is a legal adult, even though in the law, it is not actually legal, and to prosecute someone despite this would be so rare as to constitute illegal selective prosecution. The idea is the rule of law, in that no human should be able to alter the law by their own decision, either what it says or what it does in practice, and that problems in the law should be adjusted and changed by the legislative authority and not by the judiciary or the executive, and encourages the discussion of the law in the legislature and general elections rather than ignoring what the law is for convenience. They still must not prosecute if there is no evidence sufficient to convict, but the way this is determined is far more defined by rules of general applicability.",Awesomeuser90,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fgokf7/do_you_think_that_prosecutorial_discretion_as_it/,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fgokf7/do_you_think_that_prosecutorial_discretion_as_it/,5,2024-09-14 15:24:22,3,,False,0.72,Legal/Courts,2024-09-14 12:18:56.415609

FutureWhatIf,1fgog1q,FWI Challenge: Turn Donald Trump into Frank Underwood from House of Cards,"This was inspired by numerous comments by Democrats fearing that if Trump wins, he will end Democracy, the Netflix TV show House of Cards, and a conversation with my father (who told he he's seen House of Cards).

Disclaimer: Before you all take to the comments thinking I'm a MAGA supporter and demanding I delete my profile or go back to my echo-chamber, let me clarify that I do NOT support Trump in any way. I think the way he conducted himself during his time in office was abhorrent and that he is unfit to run this country. 

At this point, if Trump wins, the only way he'd really end democracy (in spite of saying he's distanced himself from Project 2025 and insisting he does not support it) is if he pretty much turns into Frank Underwood from House of Cards. The only question I have is, ""How exactly would he DO that sort of thing?""

So let's set the scene: Trump has won the 2024 US Presidential Election. During his inauguration speech, he shows his true colors, completely backtracks on ANYTHING he said during his campaign trail, admits that he lied about distancing himself from Project 2025, and proceeds to do EXACTLY what the Democratic Party feared he'd do.

I issue you the following challenge: Turn Trump into a real life Frank Underwood. Create a plausible scenario where Trump becomes the tyrannical dictator the Democrats were so scared he'd become despite the US Constitution's checks and balances.

changemyview,1fgobko,"CMV: If you support Trump, you don't care about our country","With all the information out there, I don't understand how anybody could support Trump if they have the countries best interests in mind. My biggest issue with Trump is the Jan 6th insurrection and fake elector scheme in which he tried to essentially overrule the will of the voters and the constitution.

Not only does he not regret anything that happen that day, but he still doesn't admit he lost and just continues to lie saying the election was stolen (there is no evidence of such). He also wants to pardon the Jan 6th rioters, he hired a VP in Vance who said he WOULD NOT have certified the vote if he was in Mike Pence's shoes which would have meant overruling the guardrails holding our democracy in place. He is also saying that THIS upcoming election is already rigged, so why does anybody give him the benefit of the doubt that he would put the constitution above his own selfish interests in any scenario? This is also a man who threatens to jail anybody who participated in the 2020 election ""fraud"" in which he lost every single court case and there is no evidence. Moreover the supreme court ruling essentially giving presidents immunity is very disconcerting to me.

How can any voter in good conscious vote for someone like Trump knowing this? I'm not even going to get into Trump rhetoric and obvious selfishness because I think my view is strong enough just based on the Jan 6th/Fake elector scheme event.

KamalaHarris,1fgo3e7,What’s the best way forward for Kamala’s campaign?,"The debate was an unquestionable win.

The ABC interview after that garnered more mixed views.

It’s nowhere near as bad as republicans are painting it out to be (I saw their commentary before I saw the interview, expected much worse)

Their bar is sky high for Kamala, but literally non-existent for Trump. Main thing they had against her was her lack of clear policies. 

But that line fell out the window when their candidate, who had FOUR (4) years to prepare said he had “concepts of a plan” for healthcare, no inflation plan, no childcare cost plan. But immigrants are eating dogs and geese though.

It’s very obvious to me the fearmongering on their end will increase as the election comes close.

I’m just wondering how Kamala and her team should move going forward. 

More interviews? Adversarial ones? She will definitely need to step away from the politician, canned speeches if that’s the case. 

Walz does that very well: repeats similar points, but switches it up often and keeps it natural (vs feeling rehearsed). Buttigieg too, he repeats himself a lot but people seem to have less of an issue with it because he’s more confident imo, looks interviewers in the eyes, less hesitant in choosing words etc.

Ohio,1fgo3ds,Surprised by recent changes in Ohio,"I lived in Ohio in the Youngstown-Warren area when I was younger and during university. After that I've lived abroad for years, only coming back for occasional visits. During the pandemic though, I didn't visit at all. I still live abroad.

When I left, although I knew most of Ohio isn't the place for me, I feel like many interactions I had with people were still pleasant. The state kind of felt average.. not really fitting the stereotype of either conservative or progressive places, and I knew people with diverse views on issues and society. For every person I didn't agree with, I could find someone that I did agree with.

Now when I visit, everyone I know seems to be following the same track. Almost everyone I know who hasn't left the state  has guns or thinks it's totally okay for someone to have the right not to store them properly. Everyone goes to church and has some religious affiliations (this was almost the case when I lived there, but at least then there were some less religious people). Everyone thinks Democrats are corrupt and many openly support Trump. Almost everyone has something to say about trans people and it's usually not pleasant. County fairs went from having one Democrat and Republican tent to having massive Trump flags every 10 minutes walk. People believe every conspiracy theory they find on Facebook and can't differentiate serious from non-serious sources.

Has Ohio really changed that rapidly? Is it just a Youngstown-Warren thing? Is the US really that polarized now? Did I just make the mistake of visiting in an election year?

Discussion,1fgpjpk,Conservative politics and unreality.,"The Republican president and vice presidential candidates have, in the past week and a half, begun spreading a racist lie about Haitian immigrants in Ohio. The lie originated with literal white Supremacists (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-neo-nazis-pushed-false-claims-haitians-part-hate-campaign-rcna170796) and has been proven, over and over again, to be false. 

JD Vance, the weird little Heritage Foundation pick for VP, actually acknowledged on Twitter that the story of immigrants eating pets was a lie, but still encouraged ""patriots"" to spread it. Trump, also, tends to believe whatever he thinks he saw On TV (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/trump-tv-haitians-immigrants-eating-cats/679788/). 

Hannah Arendt was a historian and philosopher who studied totalitarianism and coined the phrase ""The banality of evil"", which was her description of how high-ranking members of the Nazi party were incapable of speaking in anything except Nazi-party approved thought-terminating cliches. Michael Parenti was a historian and political scientist who, in ""Blackshirts and Reds"", wrote that Fascism relies on making otherwise rational people believe and repeat irrational statements - by accepting an irrational, untrue statement as true, conservative politicians create a bloc of people who will willingly accept further untrue statements as factual.

Consider, also, JD Vance's statement(s) that immigrants are responsible for spreading disease and how that, historically, has been used by authoritarians. 

Would the lies being pushed by the incredibly weird Republican candidates meet the criteria of a thought-terminating cliché? 

How should rational people combat conservative irrationality?",molotov__cocktease,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discussion/comments/1fgpjpk/conservative_politics_and_unreality/,/r/Discussion/comments/1fgpjpk/conservative_politics_and_unreality/,2,2024-09-14 16:07:42,2,,False,1.0,Political,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704

ProductMarketing,1fgpht6,Internal Candidate for PMM role? Salary advice needed,"Hello! Looking for advice on negotiating a raise for an internal transition to a new position.

I was offered to apply to a Product Marketing Position with my current company. I’ve been there for 2 years & my current position is “Engagement Specialist” but I basically develop patient journeys & messaging best practices for healthcare systems. A lot of is basically marketing, just to patients instead of customers of our products.

There has been a PMM role open up & I was approached by the VP of marketing to apply. I would be doing the product marketing for a few products & keep parts of my current role, like setting the best practices for patient comms across all the products.

I want to know:

1. should i expect a raise? I do have marketing experience, most of it is freelance. I’ve done some marketing projects for the company though so they know I have the knowledge.

2. Do i have any negotiating power? I’m expecting to make at least the minimum range of our Company’s range for PMM, but i don’t know what that is yet. I’ve been there for 2.5 years and have a deep understanding of all of the products, value props, and I’ve helped with implementations, sales calls, demos, product decisions, etc. So i have a ton of experience and knowledge external applicants wouldn’t have. What I do not have is specific product marketing experience.

3. anything else i should ask/consider when i apply and start interviewing for the position?

I think it’s a great opportunity, I just don’t want to sell myself short because they may look at it like a favor to me to give me the position without product marketing experience. But i also feel like i have all of the skills, knowledge and transferable skills that would benefit them if I moved to this position.

FWIW, I’m already working on launch plans for new products with our marketing dept that I’m setting the best practices for.

If we take the total applications and divide by the number of days in 2024, I put in an average of 3.81 applications per day.

The tech was very friendly and I could tell he took his time to get things right.  Of course, these large companies make them recommend anything and everything they can, but off the record was willing to be more candid. He seemed trustworthy, but I always like a second opinion.

Background on the system first. Carrier brand, installed 2011 (13yo), compressor blew its capacitor last summer.  No other known issues over its lifetime.

The two concerns he actually recommended acting on was to look at the relay Contactor on the outdoor air unit. He noted that the switch for the signal coming into the unit was corroding and was concerned that it could weld itself into the on position, which could cause the unit to not shut off.

The other thing he noted was that on startup, the unit was drawing 117-118 amps when the compressor is only rated for 112. So they recommended a ‘hard start kit’ to dissipate the excess load.

Is this work necessary? How much longevity would th add to the unit?",phillypride08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fgorfq,/r/hvacadvice/comments/1fgorfq/hard_start_kit_and_contactor_replacement/,2,2024-09-14 15:33:12,2,,False,1.0,AC,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704

I am also not going to speculate on FA signings as I want to focus more on the organizational health we currently have. 

Catcher: Jake Rogers, Dillon Dingler, Josue Briceño
- I am operating under the assumption that Liranzo does not find his home at catcher and probably projects more as a 1B or DH. Rogers will be a FA in 2027 and will be 32. Briceño could be ready in 2027 and we will have to see how Dinglers development as a hitter comes along although I have been impressed with his game calling and defense thus far. My guess is the Tigers do not re-sign Rogers. 

First Base: Spencer Torkelson, Thayron Liranzo
- Unfortunately this position hinges completely on Torkelson’s development. Count me as part of the camp that just does not see him as the long term solution there. Liranzo becoming the hitter we have seen at High A is our best chance to not have to fill this hole through FA but I think that could be the most likely long term option.

Second Base: Colt Keith, Kevin McGonigle, Hao Yu Lee, Max Anderson
- I think its clear that Colt Keith will be nailing down this spot for the long haul, and I think McGonigle projects more to 2B than at SS. Not sure I see a way for Hao Yu Lee or Max Anderson to find their way to the roster with those two options as well as Jace Jung potentially fitting better here than at third. Hao Yu Lee and Anderson could be good trade candidates as we move closer to contention.  This is our best spot depth wise in the infield.

Shortstop: Trey Sweeney, Bryce Rainer, Javier Baez (Please God no), Eddys Leonard?
- Bryce Rainer was drafted to be this team’s long term SS option and I love his game however we may not see him in a a tigers uniform until 2028 unless everything goes well for him. This is the last year of Javy’s contract if he somehow makes it there but with the way Illitch moves I am not going to count out them letting him go. Trey has been great so far and I am hoping he is the starting SS next season. Leonard’s defense is questionable at best but I think we could see him make some appearances next season.

Third Base: Jace Jung, Carson Rucker
- By far the least healthy position in the organization. I don’t see Jung sticking at third long term unless his defense improves significantly and Rucker is a longshot to be an MLB regular. Potentially could see McGonigle or Rainer move that direction depending on the development of others the next couple of seasons but most likely I see this being filled by a FA. 

Outfielders: Riley Greene, Parker Meadows, Kerry Carpenter, Matt Vierling, Wenceel Perez, Max Clark, Justyn Henry-Malloy, Justice Bigbie
- Kerry will be a FA after 2026 and will be 29 in 2027. I see us re-signing him as mostly a DH especially if Max Clark is ready to take over an outfield spot. I have full faith Riley and Parker will have locked down two of the other spots so it will be interesting to see how we approach the outfield over the next few seasons. I see vierling sticking as a long term utility player as we will need right handed bats and his ability to slot in at third and first. Wenceel is interesting as he has a lot of value as a baserunner and swith hitter and could also see him as a utility guy on a playoff team. Very difficult to see a place for Jhen on this roster and I think he is also a very likely candidate for a trade. Bigbie falls under this as well. 

This concludes my breakdown, I would love to hear any thoughts, feelings, and opinions below. If there is interest I will also make one for our long term pitching options. Go Gritty Tigs, lets make the playoffs!

LawSchool,1fgomdd,The Difference Between Boutique Firms and Small Law: A Guide For Law Students,"*Crossposted from* r/BigLawRecruiting *in case you've already seen this info.*

Hello folks! Here's a question/confusing thing I've been hearing a lot of 1L's talk about so I wanted to make a guide to help folks understand some of the nuances of how firms work.

So here is a guid on the differences between a boutique and small law firm.

**When you're navigating the legal job market, you might encounter the terms ""boutique specialized firm"" and ""small law firm.""** 

While these two types of firms may seem similar in size, they differ significantly in their scope, focus, client base, and exit opportunities. 

Understanding these distinctions can help you make more informed decisions on what kinds of jobs you want to target during and after law school.

# 1. Specialization vs. General Practice

One of the primary differences between boutique firms and small law firms is the **level of specialization.** 

**Boutique firms are typically known for their deep expertise in a particular area of law.** These firms are often highly specialized, focusing exclusively on a niche practice area, such as intellectual property, tax law, litigation, or environmental law.

Their attorneys are often well-known and recognized experts in their fields (often coming from big law by either creating the boutique themselves or lateraling into an already established boutique), and their reputation is often built on delivering high-quality, targeted legal services.

**In contrast, small law firms may not have such a narrow focus.** While some small firms do specialize in certain areas, many offer a broad range of services. A small firm might handle everything from family law and estate planning to criminal defense and business law. 

# 2. Client Base and Types of Cases

Boutique firms tend to attract clients seeking very specific legal expertise. Their clients are often businesses or individuals with complex, high-stakes issues that require in-depth knowledge of a particular area of law. 

For example, a tech startup might hire a boutique intellectual property firm to protect its patents, or a large corporation might engage a boutique litigation firm for a major lawsuit. **Because of their specialization, boutique firms often charge premium rates and may handle fewer cases overall, but the cases they do take on are usually more intricate.**

Small law firms, on the other hand, often serve a wider range of clients, including individuals, families, and small businesses. Their cases may be more routine and less complex, like drafting wills, handling divorces, or negotiating small business contracts. **Small firms are often more affordable to clients than boutiques and may take on a larger volume of less complex cases.**

# 3. Pay Differences

Another significant difference between boutique specialized firms and small law firms is compensation. 

Generally, attorneys at boutique firms tend to earn higher salaries than their counterparts at small law firms. **In fact, some can actually pay above the big law Cravath/Market rate standard and pay higher bonuses**, i.e. Selendy Gay pays Market and above market bonuses.

This is largely due to the complexity and high-stakes nature of the cases handled by boutique firms, as well as their ability to charge premium rates for their specialized expertise.

This is also particularly true for boutiques that focus on highly lucrative areas of law, such as patent litigation, mergers and acquisitions, or white-collar criminal defense. For instance, associates at top boutique firms can expect starting salaries in the $200,000 to $250,000 range, which is comparable to or higher than starting salaries at some large firms.

**In contrast, attorneys at small law firms generally earn lower salaries, often in the range of $60,000 to $120,000, depending on location, firm size, and the type of cases they handle.** 

# 4. Hiring Selectivity

Both boutique specialized firms and small law firms can be selective in their hiring, but the level of selectivity and the criteria they use may differ.

**Boutique Firms: Due to their niche focus and need for highly specialized knowledge, boutique firms tend to be extremely selective in hiring law students and lateral attorneys.** 

Many boutique firms prefer candidates who have excelled academically at top law schools, have prior experience or interest in their specialized area of law, and demonstrate a strong ability to manage complex legal issues.

For instance, boutique litigation firms might prioritize candidates who have completed prestigious judicial clerkships or who have been recognized for outstanding legal writing. **As a result, getting a job at a boutique firm can be just as competitive, if not more so, than securing a position in big law.**

**Small Law Firms: Small law firms, while still selective, may not place the same emphasis on law school prestige or academic performance.** Instead, they may focus more on finding candidates who have strong practical skills, the ability to handle a variety of legal matters, and are a good fit with the firm’s culture/put time into networking. 

Small firms often value law students or new lawyers who have had internships or work experience in relevant areas of law, particularly in the firm’s local market. Because they typically deal with a broader range of legal issues, small firms might also prioritize candidates with adaptability and a willingness to take on different types of cases.

# 5. Structure and Culture

The internal structure and culture of boutique and small law firms can also differ significantly. 

**Boutique firms often resemble larger law firms in terms of hierarchy, with a clear division between partners, associates, and support staff.**

Because of their specialized focus, attorneys at boutique firms may collaborate more intensively within their niche area, working closely together on complex legal issues. The culture in these firms is often driven by a shared passion/background for their area of expertise and a commitment to staying at the forefront of legal developments in that niche because that means clients with deeper pockets will be more willing to pay premium rates.

**Small law firms, on the other hand, tend to have a more informal and flexible structure.**

Attorneys at small firms may handle a wider variety of cases, and there is often more overlap in roles. For example, an attorney at a small firm might handle both litigation and transactional work, depending on the needs of their clients. 

# 6. Examples of Famous Boutique Firms

There are several boutique firms that have gained national recognition for their specialized expertise. Some notable examples include:

**Susman Godfrey:** A powerhouse in the field of complex commercial litigation

**Irell & Manella:** Specializing in intellectual property litigation, this firm has gained a reputation for winning major patent and intellectual property cases, often against much larger firms.

**Other examples:** Gjerset & Lorenz, Selendy Gay, Tensegrity

These boutique firms have set themselves apart by focusing on specific, high-demand areas of law, building a reputation for excellence, and commanding top-tier fees for their services.

**That’s it for now!**

The tech was very friendly and I could tell he took his time to get things right. Of course, these large companies make them recommend anything and everything they can, but off the record was willing to be more candid. He seemed trustworthy, but I always like a second opinion. 

Background on the system first. Carrier brand, installed 2011 (13yo), compressor blew its capacitor last summer. No other known issues over its lifetime. 

The two concerns he actually recommended acting on was to look at the relay Contactor on the outdoor air unit. He noted that the switch for the signal coming into the unit had started corroding and was concerned that it could weld itself into the on position, which could cause the unit to not shut off. 

The other thing he noted was that on startup, the unit was drawing 117-118 amps when the compressor is only rated for 112.

Advice,1fgod0i,"27m stress and overthinking from failing career path and realizing  something else that interests me, what should I do?","I’m starting my 5th year of studying psychology (BA). I study online so it would take me 1.5 years to finish my first degree.

It’s hard to become a therapist. Constantly comparing yourself to others because it’s a very competitive field with only few getting accepted to a masters program.

While my average meets the criteria (90+/100) I also need to get letters of recommendation and what mostly troubles me is I have to pass a 5 hours long exam that filter candidates. I soon going to take it but because of stress and procrastination I won’t do well (too much to learn in 2 weeks), good news I can take it once again next year.

HomeImprovement,1fgoc3w,I AUTOMATED 1000 JOB APPLICATIONS in Just 24 Hours and Scored 50 INTERVIEWS!,"So, how did I pull this off? Honestly, it came from a place of frustration. After months of sending out resumes and hearing nothing back, I realized I was going up against more than just other candidatesI was battling algorithms designed to weed out applicants before a human ever saw my name. Thats when I decided to take matters into my own hands and created a little AI magic.

This tool I built? Its pretty amazing. It takes your information, dissects job descriptions, and crafts personalized CVs and cover letters for each application. It even tackles those tedious recruiter questions. While I sat there, feeling lost in the job hunt, this bot was busy applying to hundreds of jobs on my behalf.

The Job Market Is Changing Fast The recruiting landscape is increasingly dominated by automation. Its not just about who you are anymore; its about how well you can navigate the systems designed to filter you out. You can whip up a CV in seconds, and cover letters have become just another checkbox. Skills are matched to job descriptions by cold algorithms. And lets be honest, recruiters are becoming less involved in the process. The key to standing out now is to outsmart the machine, and thats exactly what this bot does. It fine-tunes everything, helping your application slip past those automated gatekeepers.

Why I Had to Take Action The job market is evolving, and AI is bulldozing through it, automating anything it can. Companies will eventually have to figure out when to bring humans back in, but who knows if they will? Interviews could be the last refuge for us, or everything might just continue to feel more robotic.

The Unexpected Response Surprisingly, this project really took off. With over 12,000 stars on GitHub and a buzzing community of 3,000 people on Telegram discussing it, I never anticipated it would resonate so much. I guess Im not alone in feeling the pressure. If youre curious, you can give it a whirl; its free. Just input your info, and let the bot do its thing, applying for jobs even when youre ready to call it quits.

Check it out here: https://github.com/feder-cr/linkedIn_auto_jobs_applier_with_AI

Use it Wisely, or Dont I didnt create this tool for anyone to depend on it too heavily. Its just a resource, a little hack in the system. Whether you choose to use it or not is up to you. I just know the job market is tough, and Ive found a way to keep pushing forward.",AIHawk_Founder,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1fgoc3w/i_automated_1000_job_applications_in_just_24/,/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1fgoc3w/i_automated_1000_job_applications_in_just_24/,4,2024-09-14 15:14:03,0,,False,0.07,None,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704
changemyview,1fgobko,"CMV: If you support Trump, you don't care about our country","With all the information out there, I don't understand how anybody could support Trump if they have the countries best interests in mind. My biggest issue with Trump is the Jan 6th insurrection and fake elector scheme in which he tried to essentially overrule the will of the voters and the constitution.

Not only does he not regret anything that happen that day, but he still doesn't admit he lost and just continues to lie saying the election was stolen (there is no evidence of such). He also wants to pardon the Jan 6th rioters, he hired a VP in Vance who said he WOULD NOT have certified the vote if he was in Mike Pence's shoes which would have meant overruling the guardrails holding our democracy in place. He is also saying that THIS upcoming election is already rigged, so why does anybody give him the benefit of the doubt that he would put the constitution above his own selfish interests in any scenario? This is also a man who threatens to jail anybody who participated in the 2020 election ""fraud"" in which he lost every single court case and there is no evidence. Moreover the supreme court ruling essentially giving presidents immunity is very disconcerting to me.

How can any voter in good conscious vote for someone like Trump knowing this? I'm not even going to get into Trump rhetoric and obvious selfishness because I think my view is strong enough just based on the Jan 6th/Fake elector scheme event.

Whether you blindly support Trump, or just play team sports and vote for your party no matter the candidate, you don't truly care about the country because either A. You turn a blind eye to the stuff Trump has done and live in an echo chamber, or B. You don't care enough to do the bare minimum research on a candidate.",ZacPack,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fgobko/cmv_if_you_support_trump_you_dont_care_about_our/,/r/changemyview/comments/1fgobko/cmv_if_you_support_trump_you_dont_care_about_our/,364,2024-09-14 15:13:22,91,,False,0.56,Election,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704

recruitinghell,1fgo7ow,Signs you get the job? ,"I had an interview with Delta Air Lines TechOps on Thursday.

I feel my interview went pretty well. There were two guys who interviewed me. When I met them, I shook hands, gave them papers of my resume (they looked impressed), and told them that I’m Deaf but that I would still use my voice to communicate (because I want to show them that I’m capable of doing anything and that my disability isn’t stopping me), and they could use a speech-to-text app for me to read their responses. It worked out great. They were happy to help make the interview easier. 

They asked me to introduce myself, and I told them that ever since I went to an airshow when I was a young boy, I’ve been fascinated with everything in the sky. I also told them that I obtained a solo skydiving license, and one of them said I’m braver than him 😂 I also mentioned that experiencing this makes me deeply connected to the aviation world. 

They asked me five behavioral questions, and I answered them all. I felt good about most of my answers, except for one where I wasn’t too sure because I haven’t really encountered that situation, but I did my best. One of them asked me a few questions about my work during the questions, like he is interested and curious to know more. He also mentioned that I didn’t mind working overtime, and I said I wouldn’t mind at all – if I have to do it, I will (I think he liked my attitude).

At the end of the interview, I asked how I did during the interview and he said “very well,” with a thumbs up. That got me excited. Then they asked what I was doing this weekend, and I said not much, probably babysitting my niece (and I showed them pic of my niece, they were aww at it). I also share a bit about myself with my deafness, I explained that as a deaf person, speaking is tough because my hearing aid broken and I can’t hear you talking or myself. He looked at me like “Wait, you can hear some?” I said yes, with a hearing aid, I can hear pretty much everything. He was impressed because he thought I was fully deaf. Finally, he told me he will make a decision and would let me and other candidates know by today or Monday about who gets the job. And he mentioned “if you’re successful, I will call you and ask if you still want the job”. I thanked them, saying I’m excited about this opportunity and working for Delta is my dream, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes. We shook hands again, and that was it. 

Today is Saturday and I’m not going to lie, I’m anxious about it but I also have been positive mindsets. I’m feeling really good about this one! I really hope I get it because it’s my dream to work in the aviation industry and my experience is perfect for this role.

hockey,1fgo5zg,PWHL Expansion candidates; where would you like the league to expand next?,"According to ESPN at the halfway point of last season, the league is "" putting aside questions about expansion in Season 2 or beyond for now.""   
Where would you realistically like to see the league expand to if they were to grow their footprint in season 3?  
---  
My take:  
I think they'd likely go with a 2 team expansion. I'd personally like to see Chicago and Baltimore get teams. Minnesota can't be the only team in the Midwest and given Chicago is the 3rd biggest city in the United States, it's sort of a no-brainer. As for Baltimore; before the original 6 cities were announced the Athletic said ""According to multiple PWHL sources, the league looked at Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and London, Ont., among others."" If the league wants to add another Mid-Atlantic team, I believe the best option would be CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore as the city sits an hour from DC, two hours from Philly, and four hours from Pittsburgh. I also don't think Capital One Arena in DC would be willing to house a PWHL team considering they wouldn't be owned by Monumental Sports and citing the attendance problems that sent the WNBA Mystics to a smaller basketball-specific arena in Southeast DC, the risk would outweigh the reward. As for Pittsburgh, I think adding a team to the DC-Baltimore Metro Area, which has a population of just under 10 million people, is more desirable from a marketing perspective.

KamalaHarris,1fgo3e7,What’s the best way forward for Kamala’s campaign?,"The debate was an unquestionable win.

The ABC interview after that garnered more mixed views.

It’s nowhere near as bad as republicans are painting it out to be (I saw their commentary before I saw the interview, expected much worse)

Their bar is sky high for Kamala, but literally non-existent for Trump. Main thing they had against her was her lack of clear policies. 

But that line fell out the window when their candidate, who had FOUR (4) years to prepare said he had “concepts of a plan” for healthcare, no inflation plan, no childcare cost plan. But immigrants are eating dogs and geese though.

It’s very obvious to me the fearmongering on their end will increase as the election comes close.

I’m just wondering how Kamala and her team should move going forward. 

More interviews? Adversarial ones? She will definitely need to step away from the politician, canned speeches if that’s the case. 

Walz does that very well: repeats similar points, but switches it up often and keeps it natural (vs feeling rehearsed). Buttigieg too, he repeats himself a lot but people seem to have less of an issue with it because he’s more confident imo, looks interviewers in the eyes, less hesitant in choosing words etc.

Does anyone have any tips? I just want to make sure I don’t get complacent as I’m under no impression that I’m guaranteed to get the role.  I’m pretty much fulfilling the SEO role already anyway but know that if I’m not having a good day for the interview or someone else surprises the panel by having experience in our area etc, nothing is guaranteed. 

I’m of course going to put a lot of time into the application and detailed notes about the behaviours, and seek advice from colleagues at SEO/SIO level.

Luxembourg,1fgnvv4,honest question.. what do you expect from Luxembourg? ,"i keep reading here there is nothing to do, that there is a village etc etc...but seriously but what do people want? 

luxembourg city has all that a city has to offer in europe. yes closing time are in par with brussels or germany.. (closed on sundays and after 6-8pm). if you come from latam where everything is open almost constantly it was a shock..

the night life around clausen until 3am on weekend  is pretty decent. there are concert, festivals like e-lake, loa, almost all  mayor rock.pop.metal acts always stops at rockhal, or den atelier... 

you go to the center and is packed with people mostly when sunny days lots of people in place d'armes. 

the xmas market is quite fun and there is lots of people. 

so what does people want? why so many backslash/rants around luxembourg fun?  that the only thing to do is just ikea and meat balls? or hiking. 

is that dark humour of this sub or? 

is it because they can't find a kebab open a 5am like in paris or brussels? that there aren't pakistanese night shops selling buzz until 7am 

I was recently in london and i was unimpressed all pubs closed at 11pm tops.. if you want to have a drink after you had to go to some club where they asked you 10 gpb just to enter  and a gin tonic cost almost 20 euros (16 pounds).

AfricaVoice,1fgnvk1,"Biden to make first Africa visit with Angola trip in coming weeks, sources say. ","[Link](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/us/2024/09/13/biden-to-make-first-africa-visit-with-angola-trip-in-coming-weeks-sources-say/)



President Joe Biden is planning a trip to Angola in the coming weeks, fulfilling a promise that would make him the first US head of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa since Barack Obama in 2015, three sources told Reuters.

The trip, which is being finalised, is likely to occur after the UN General Assembly meeting in September and before the November 5 presidential election, one source said.

The White House declined to comment to Reuters on the trip plans.

Mr Biden had hoped to visit Angola late last year but the trip was postponed after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October.

Mr Biden has pledged closer US partnership with democracies on the African continent, as China invests heavily in the region.

The Democratic President hosted Angolan President Joao Lourenco at the White House last November and raised the prospect of a visit during their Oval Office meeting. In May, he said he planned to make an official visit to Africa in February if he won the US presidential election.

Mr Biden would be the first US president to visit the oil- and resource-rich African country, one of the sources said, following a first visit by a US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, in September 2023.

President Joe Biden and African leaders arrive for a family photo during the US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022. AP

Keen to counter China's investments in Africa, the US has been supporting a project that links resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo to Angola's Lobito port by rail to bypass road congestion on the copper and cobalt route.

Mr Biden, who took office in 2021, has faced some criticism for not visiting the African continent earlier in his term after hosting a US-African leaders summit in Washington in December 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Africa in 2023, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken did this year.

Mr Biden's trip would come weeks before a US presidential election that remains tight, with recent polls showing Democratic candidate Ms Harris tied with her Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, whose derogatory reference to African nations continues to reverberate in African diplomatic circles.

StockInvest,1fgnrxm,SPY Analysis: Stable Yet Cautious as Inflation Concerns Mount 📈💹 | Should You Hold or Fold? 🤔,"**Technical Analysis**



The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) closed at $562.01 on September 13, 2024, marking a modest gain of $2.92 (0.52%). The stock has been relatively stable, with a low of $559.45 and a high of $563.03 during the same trading day. Currently, SPY is close to its yearly high of $565.16, suggesting a resistance level at $562.07, which could limit upside momentum in the near term. With the RSI hovering at 50, SPY indicates neutral momentum, exhibiting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. 



The moving averages further corroborate the stock's stability, as the 50-day moving average stands at $549.65, well below the current price, affirming a bullish short-term trend. The 200-day moving average at $515.93, also significantly lower than the current price, indicates long-term upward momentum. However, with average trading volumes declining (33.91 million against an average of 51.00 million), SPY could face increasing volatility as market participants position themselves for potential headwinds.

Given the ATR of $1.38, the upcoming trading day on September 16, 2024, might see SPY trading within a range of approximately $560.63 to $563.39, dictated by its recent high and the defined resistance level. 



**Fundamental Analysis**



Fundamentally, SPY is trading at a P/E ratio of 28.31, highlighting a premium valuation for the ETF amid growing concerns regarding market corrections. The reported EPS of $19.85 indicates strong earnings, yet concerns about overvaluation persist, particularly as inflation remains a point of contention in the broader economic landscape. Recent commentary points to caution surrounding SPY's intrinsic value, with discussions suggesting that the current valuation may not adequately reflect potential inflationary pressures. 



The news cycle around SPY suggests an evolving narrative where cautious optimism is met with bearish sentiment in the context of inflation and valuation metrics. Specifically, market analysts have highlighted a cautious stance on potential interest rate cuts amid solid economic fundamentals, positing that the macroeconomic conditions may inhibit aggressive market advancements. 



**Performance Prediction**



For the next trading day, the technical indicators suggest that SPY may test resistance at $562.07 but could close below this level if selling pressure escalates. Over the upcoming week, continued market commentary on inflation and economic stability will likely play a significant role in SPY's performance. A challenge to the resistance level at $565 could arise, but any movement above this threshold would require strong bullish momentum, which sounds doubtful considering the current economic atmosphere. 



**Intrinsic Value and Long-Term Investment Potential**



Considering the current market conditions and SPY’s valuation metrics, the intrinsic value appears stretched, especially when juxtaposed against the historical context of P/E ratios. Should inflation figures remain resilient and ongoing economic growth prompt interest rate stability, SPY may experience turbulence in maintaining its current valuation. 



Long-term investment potential for SPY remains moderate but risks are prevalent. While a stable S&P 500 backdrop provides some security, the high CAPE ratio indicates that significant downside risk exists should broader economic indicators shift unfavorably. 



**Overall Evaluation**



Given the analysis, SPY is categorized as a 'Hold' candidate. While exhibiting short-term stability, [...]

Sacklaybluesub,1fgnqiz,Banned from r/libertarian. Unclear why.,"I thought Libertarians were supposed to be a third political party alternative to both Democrats and Republicans. I thought Libertarians were critical of both of those parties, including the current presidential candidates. But when I went on the r/libertarian sub and posted a comment that simply pointed out that Putin obviously would prefer Trump to win - a perfectly appropriate AND OBVIOUSLY TRUE OBSERVATION - one of the moderators immediately removed my comment and banned me from the sub, accusing me in his ban message of being a ""liberal with TDS (Trump derangement syndrome)."" When I responded to that message, he escalated further by reporting me to Reddit admins who suspended my account for 3 days for harassment.

Why such an extreme, knee jerk reaction from a moderator of sub that claims to be associated with ""reason?"" He didn't bother to engage in a debate with me about my comment and attempt to clarify where we disagree and, importantly, how my comment was inconsistent with OP's post. If the moderator honestly believed my criticism of Trump for his openly self-reported connections with Putin was so irrelevant to libertarianism that it warranted a ban from the sub, then why didn't he also remove the OP post criticizing Democrats for ""being happy about Putin endorsing Harris,"" when that is so obviously false anyway? It's possible some individual dems might see that as a positive, but they would be the rare exception, not the rule that OP's post seems to suggest.

Pointing out this false claim hardly confirms that I'm a liberal, as the
moderator insisted. If he had done his due diligence as a responsible sub moderator who signed up for a legitimate discussion gatekeeping role, taking a quick look at some of my other recent comments including on his own sub, before taking such drastic actions against me for my comment, he would have easily seen that I'm a moderate conservative critical of both Trump and Harris, not a liberal as he accused me of.

My conclusion is that this moderator is not actually committed to Libertarianism and rational thought. It's clear from his knee jerk reaction to my comment that he is a full-blown Fox News addicted Trumper. The fact that he's permitted to act the way he did there further suggests that all the moderators of r/libertarian are also Trumpers, and the sub itself was created to prevent actual Libertarians from setting up a sub with that name for the purpose of limiting open criticism of their beloved Republican party, and to keep the Libertarian party irrelevant as a potential third party.

This is really unfortunate for so many reasons, but it's also informative to me as to one of the likely reasons why the Libertarian party can't get its shit together and win an election: when people attempt to join them, they quickly turn them away without a second thought.

Spiderman,1fgnq6c,An idea i had regarding the MCU spiderman 4 movie multiverse rumours,"Just noting: I'm not very experienced in reddit posting and this is my first time in this subreddit. I'm not sure if this has been discussed here before or if it is obvious or wrong. I just wanted to share my thoughts. I have also read a number of spider-man comics but not too many, I prefer x-men and scarlet spider.

Spoilers for morbius and no way home. + a bit of homecoming

So, I saw a number of rumours saying that spider-man 4 is going to be a multiverse movie, + people getting upset about it. I just remembered this rumour whilst thinking about vulture in morbius and I want to share my theory. 

My theory is that if it truly is a multiverse movie, then it may center around the sinister 6. Now in no way home there was already kinda a sinister 5 or 4 (unless I'm missing someone). But morbius ended with the vulture recruiting morbius for what is assumed to be the sinister six. They also seem to be in the venom universe, so vulture, venom, morbius, then kraven and rhino since theres going to be a kraven movie with rhino in it. 

But whos the 6th member then? So heres the next part. Vultures main plan seems to be revenge on spider-man (I think? I'm not sure, haven't watched homecoming in a while), so they somehow find a way to dimension travel back to the MCU. So theres the multiverse part of the movie. theres only 5 of them, and then, they recruit the scorpion. 

In the post credits scene (?) Of homecoming, the vulture ends up in the same prison as the scorpion. Though it seems they aren't exactly on good terms? And he doesn't tell scorpion spider-man's identity either so I'm not sure.

So maybe vulture will recruit scorpion as the 6th member (i think the shocker may be a candidate too? Though I'm even less sure on that) and we'll have a sinister 6 movie!

I personally think that would be cool, though I'm not sure how they'll execute it. Of course this is just my theory based off of the multiverse rumours.

So... Any thoughts? Is this plausible? Is it stupid? Did someone talk about this before?

FireEmblemHeroes,1fgnna5,Predicting the remaining Grand Hero Battle candidates: Day 4: Thracia 776,"The results from Genealogy are Manfroy, Bloom, Ishtore, Lombard, Chulainn, Beowolf, and a four way tie between Aida, Chagall, Reptor and Hannibal. It should be noted Manfroy was well in the lead with 20 votes. Ishtore is the one that surprises me, guess people like the Ishtar connection. Also surprised Lombard is so far ahead of Reptor, guess people want to see a Helswath user more than the duo with the slightly larger plot focus. Now, on to Thracia 776.

Thracia is in a situation quite like Archanea with only one proper enemy left, Raydrik. Though there's a decent chance of seeing Dryas since they've already put August in (August was a banner unit though, so they might follow suit). He only has one arm in terms of canon which would be interesting to see on a sprite. Anyway, the majority of GHB units will be playable enemies, so the focus would largely be on which. 31 playable units to get into Thracia so this vote is set to 8 again.

Diverticulitis,1fgnk3z,Help please!,"I am a 46yo male who has been dealing with an ongoing DV flare since May of this year. Multiple courses of antibiotics, 3 day hospital stay, and 5 trips to the ER later , I am due to see the surgeon on the 24th of this month. My last ER visit showed diverticulosis without the presence of infection and my blood work was spotless. I have drastically changed my diet and lifestyle in hopes of managing this on my own. I went from basically a modified carnivore diet to a low fiber diet with chicken as my main source of protein. I cut my coffee intake to a quarter of the usual intake and I drink a ton of water. I have noticed since the diet change that my bowel movements went from regular like clockwork to almost non existent. I was finally able to go this morning and it was a combination of pencil thin and ribbon tape. I hade to strain to get it out ( I know...I know.. you're not supposed to strain) but a guy just had to get something out so I would stop obsessing about a BM. Bottom line here, I'm scared guys. If I absolutely have to get the surgery I will. I would rather deal with this through lifestyle changes and I have been really diligent in my attempts. The surgical team at the ER said I was not a candidate for them to keep me and perform the surgery and the only thing they could think of was smoldering DV.I was told many years ago that I have IBS and I'm wondering what, if any role that might be playing in all of this?

HeatherCoxRichardson,1fgniyw,"September 14, 2024","After bomb threats today, officials had to evacuate two elementary schools in Springfield, Ohio, and move the students to a different location. They had to close a middle school altogether. This is the second day bomb threats have closed schools and public buildings after MAGA Republicans have spread the lie that Haitian immigrants there have been eating white people's pets. Haitian immigrants, who were welcomed to Springfield by officials eager to revitalize the city and who are there legally, say they are afraid. 

Hunter Walker and Josh Kovensky of *Talking Points Memo* today explained where the lie had come from and how it had spread. More than two months ago, they wrote, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, who is Trump’s vice presidential running mate, began to speak about Springfield at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, trying to tie rising housing prices to immigrants. The next day, at the National Conservatism conference, Vance accused “illegals” of overwhelming the city. 

On August 10, about a dozen neo-Nazis of the “Blood Tribe” organization showed up in Springfield, where one of their leaders said the city had been taken over by “degenerate third worlders” and blamed the Jews for the influx of migrants. The neo-Nazis stayed and, on August 27, showed up at a meeting of the city council, where their leader threatened council members. On September 1, another white supremacist group, Patriot Front, held its own “protest to the mass influx of unassimilable Haitian migrants” in the city. Right-wing social media posters pushed the story, usually with “witnesses” to events in the city coming from elsewhere.

In late August, posting in a private Facebook group, a resident said they had heard that Haitian immigrants had butchered a neighbor’s cat for food. Vance reposted that rumor to attack Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, on whom he is trying to hang undocumented immigration although it was Trump who convinced Republicans to kill a strong bipartisan border bill this spring. Springfield police and the city manager told news outlets there was no truth to the rumors.  

Nonetheless, on September 10, Vance told his people to “keep the cat memes flowing,” even though—or perhaps because—the rumors were putting people in his own state in danger.

Trump repeated the lie at the presidential debate that night, claiming, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Today, President Joe Biden demanded Trump stop his attacks on Haitian-Americans, but Trump doubled down, promising to deport the Haitian immigrants in Springfield if he is elected, although they are here legally. 

The widespread ridicule of Trump’s statement has obscured that this attack on Ohio’s immigrants is part of an attempt to regain control of the Senate. Convincing Ohio voters that the immigrants in their midst are subhuman could help Republicans defeat popular Democratic incumbent senator Sherrod Brown, who has held his seat since 2007. Brown and Montana’s Jon Tester, both Democrats in states that supported Trump in 2020, are key to controlling the Senate. 

Two Republican super PACs, one of which is linked to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have booked more than $82 million of ad space in Ohio between Labor Day and the election and are focusing on immigration. 

Taking control of the Senate would enable Republicans not only to block all popular Democratic legislation, as they did with gun reform after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, but to continue to establish control of America’s judicial system. So long as their judges are in place to make law from the bench, what the majority of Americans want doesn’t matter.

In 1986, when it was clear that most Americans did not support the policies put in place by the Reagan Republicans, the Reagan appointees at the Justice Department broke tradition to ensure that candidates for judgeships shared their partisanship. Their goal, said the president’s attorney general, Ed Meese, was to “institutionalize the Reagan revolution so it can’t be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections.” 

That principle held going forward. Federal judgeships depend on Senate confirmation, and when McConnell became Senate minority leader in 2007, he worked to make sure Democrats could not put their own appointees onto the bench. He held up so many of President Barack Obama’s nominees for federal judgeships that in 2013 Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) prohibited filibusters on certain judicial nominees.

McConnell also made it clear that he would do everything he could to make sure that Democrats could not pass laws, weaponizing the filibuster so that nothing could become law without 60 votes in the Senate.

McConnell became Senate majority leader in 2015 when voters gave Republicans control of the Senate, and when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell refused even to hold hearings for President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. McConnell’s justification for this unprecedented obstruction was that Obama’s March nomination was too close to an election, but the underlying reason for the 2016 delay was at least in part his recognition that hopes of pushing the Supreme Court to the right, especially on the issue of abortion, were likely to get evangelical voters to the polls.

Trump won in 2016, and Republicans got control of the Senate. In 2017, when Democrats tried to filibuster Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia’s long-empty seat, then–majority leader McConnell killed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The end of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees meant that McConnell could push through Trump’s nominees Brett Kavanaugh, with just 50 votes, and Amy Coney Barrett, with just 52 (in late October 2020, with voting for the next president already underway). 

Throughout his tenure as Senate majority leader, McConnell made judicial confirmations a top priority, churning through nominations even when the coronavirus pandemic shut everything else down. Right-wing plaintiffs are now seeking out those judges, like Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, to decide in their favor. Kacsmaryk challenged the FDA’s approval of the drug mifepristone, which can be used in abortions, thus threatening to ban it nationwide.

Meanwhile, at the Supreme Court, Trump appointees are joining with right-wing justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito to overturn precedents established long ago, including the right to abortion. 

Controlling the country through the courts was the plan behind stacking the courts with Republican nominees and weaponizing the filibuster to stop Democrats from passing legislation. In March 2024, in *Slate*, legal analyst Mark Joseph Stern noted that McConnell “realized you don’t need to win elections to enact Republican policy. You don’t need to change hearts and minds. You don’t need to push ballot initiatives or win over the views of the people. All you have to do is stack the courts. You only need 51 votes in the Senate to stack the courts with far-right partisan activists…\[a\]nd they will enact Republican policies under the guise of judicial review, policies that could never pass through the democratic process. And those policies will be bulletproof, because they will be called ‘law.’”

When he took office, President Joe Biden went to work putting his own mark on the federal judiciary. Almost two thirds of his appointees are women, and 62% are people of color. He appointed the first Black female justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the Supreme Court. But now, Republicans are hoping to retake the Senate to make sure that those appointments will stop, along with any more legislation. Their right-wing appointees to the courts will take the business of lawmaking out of the hands of American majorities.

Republican leaders are throwing everything they’ve got at the Senate races in Montana and Ohio, where they hope they can pick up the seat they need to take control of the Senate.

Attacks on immigrants in Ohio might move that needle. 

In 1890, Republicans faced a similar problem. They had lost the popular vote in 1888, although they installed Republican president Benjamin Harrison in office through the Electoral College, and knew the Democrats would soon far outnumber their own voters. So they set out to guarantee that they could never lose the Senate, which should enable them to kill popular Democratic legislation. 

But they misjudged the electorate, and in the 1890 midterm election, voters gave control of the House to the Democrats by a margin of two to one, and control of the Senate came down to a single seat, that of a senator from South Dakota. In those days, state legislatures chose their state’s senators, and shortly after it became clear that control of the Senate was going to depend on that South Dakota seat, U.S. Army troops went to South Dakota to rally voters by putting down an “Indian uprising” in which no people had died and no property had been damaged. 

Fueled on false stories of “savages” who were attacking white settlers, the inexperienced soldiers were the ones who pulled the triggers to kill more than 250 Lakotas on December 29, but the Wounded Knee Massacre started in Washington, D.C.

Advice,1fgnipy,what do I do about my friend group?,"hi, I'm 16M and I have a small friend group at school. I moved back to my old school which is a story for another time but I was informed that my friend A (14F) had a birthday party on the same day as a concert I had planned on going to. it wouldn't have been a huge deal if the concert was in the same city as I live in. it wasn't. it was in Nottingham. A was pissed off and didn't tell me directly and seemed to make a joke about it to my memory. A spent the day with my two other friends, B (15M) and C (15M), which i had no problem with. i apologized because the concert was planned over half a year in advance because the tickets were a Christmas present. I would've gone if I could've but I couldn't. I live in a city very far away from the concert venue. I'm English so I had to travel down to said city. 

this wasn't the end of the issue though. after the concert, which was great, my mental health started going downhill due to the stress of school and GCSEs. I was getting snappier because something else happened involving my exam desk, my candidate number and legal name. my mental health isn't any better but A, B and C confronted me and told me that I was killing the mood. i felt horrible and apologized. my instinct was to isolate myself and try to reflect and get better. I asked B how i could make myself better to be around and he said ""just cheer up"". this friend group had a past with mental health issues so I was shocked when he told me that. what made me feel even worse was when he followed that up saying something even worse. i didn't know what to respond to that with so I broke down and ended up in A&E because of my mental health

when I went into school for the last day, i stayed completely on my own and A, B and C went out without inviting me. they all excluded me from conversations when I saw them in the morning and I just felt really out of place. I know damn well they have a separate group chat without me in it which kinda hurts but I took the chance to leave all the group chats with them in it. what hurts even more is that C was one of my closest friends and he was friends with me since primary school. it hurts like hell to lose him but I know i need to move on. i just feel like if I tried to prevent that whole concert from happening, this wouldn't have happened. what do I do?",Only_Indication5350,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fgnipy/what_do_i_do_about_my_friend_group/,/r/Advice/comments/1fgnipy/what_do_i_do_about_my_friend_group/,1,2024-09-14 14:37:27,2,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704

I had a weak/unpressed claim, hit 1000 gold and then all of a sudden all the electors just switch their votes to me, even though there's TONS of available Salians (including children of the current HRE) to choose from that have a much stronger claim to the throne.    
  
All of the electors have 80+ opinion of me, and prior to the switch they were voting fairly normally, for instance, most of them were voting for the current HRE's son, but as soon as I crossed that 1000 gold threshold, BOOM. No hooks, no special treatment of the electors, I have really been ignoring the HRE court as much as possible.

Normally I wouldn't mind becoming the emperor but I'm just tryin to do the Frisian thing. I don't want to deal with an empire, but also I like my current protagonist and dont want to stress him out until abdication/death.",Intelligent_Pea5351,https://www.reddit.com/r/ck3/comments/1fgnhy8/hre_or_why_you_gotta_do_this_to_me/,/r/ck3/comments/1fgnhy8/hre_or_why_you_gotta_do_this_to_me/,2,2024-09-14 14:36:31,1,,False,0.67,None,2024-09-14 12:18:57.632704

Discussion,1fgpjpk,Conservative politics and unreality.,"The Republican president and vice presidential candidates have, in the past week and a half, begun spreading a racist lie about Haitian immigrants in Ohio. The lie originated with literal white Supremacists (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-neo-nazis-pushed-false-claims-haitians-part-hate-campaign-rcna170796) and has been proven, over and over again, to be false. 

JD Vance, the weird little Heritage Foundation pick for VP, actually acknowledged on Twitter that the story of immigrants eating pets was a lie, but still encouraged ""patriots"" to spread it. Trump, also, tends to believe whatever he thinks he saw On TV (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/trump-tv-haitians-immigrants-eating-cats/679788/). 

Hannah Arendt was a historian and philosopher who studied totalitarianism and coined the phrase ""The banality of evil"", which was her description of how high-ranking members of the Nazi party were incapable of speaking in anything except Nazi-party approved thought-terminating cliches. Michael Parenti was a historian and political scientist who, in ""Blackshirts and Reds"", wrote that Fascism relies on making otherwise rational people believe and repeat irrational statements - by accepting an irrational, untrue statement as true, conservative politicians create a bloc of people who will willingly accept further untrue statements as factual.

Consider, also, JD Vance's statement(s) that immigrants are responsible for spreading disease and how that, historically, has been used by authoritarians. 

Would the lies being pushed by the incredibly weird Republican candidates meet the criteria of a thought-terminating cliché?

BoomersBeingFools,1fgpjl8,Boomer obsessed with Rainbow or Gold-Backed Currency,"I work at a bank and we have one boomer customer who is borderline OBSESSED with this idea that ALL U.S. currency is going to be switched over to gold-backed currency he refers to as 'Rainbow dollars', and he will. not. give. it. up. 

It started back at the tail end of 21, where we had some customers borderline fighting us on the phone, stating that they NEEDED to get these Rainbow Dollars NOW and that the BANKS SHOULD HAVE THESE ALREADY. The reason for the urgency was that this new currency was going to go into effect at the start of 2022, if you didn't have these new bills you couldn't buy ANYTHING. We'd never heard of it prior to this phone call... So, yeah, we're sorry, but we don't have that and we have no means to order it. 

Later in 22, same thing again only in person this time. You should have all these rainbow dollars by now, can I order some? No. We checked, there are no plans or announcements of any kind that state the US government is going to start issuing anything called 'Rainbow Dollars.' We try to get more information from the customer about where he's hearing this information, and he won't cite sources. He just insists the change is coming, you'll see, end of this year will be when you guys have to send back the money you have and get those Rainbow Dollars.

Now we've hit '23 and at least the Rainbow Dollars part has disappeared, but he's still banging away at this idea that our currency is going to get off this 'inflation-prone fiat crap' and 'gold-backed dollars will end all this inflation mess for good!' I'm personally lost at this point because I don't see how this sort of change is going to 'fix' inflation... and again, I'm looking for sources because over the past two years I just can't find anything to support this guys claims anywhere.

Earlier this year he comes back and one of our tellers is running a lot of bills through a bill counter, the boomer comes in with some business and is just SMILING. I was helping him with his stuff and he looks me with triumph and says ""Good, you're counting everything to send back, told you."" I stop everything and turn right to him, because now I've done a little digging around and lay out a few facts. First, there's no announcement from any government outlet supporting what he's saying. A change in how currency LOOKS is a huge deal, such as when they updated the 5s/10s/20s/50s/100s with all the new security features, and there's nothing about these new bills. Furthermore, there are actual regulations that need to change, a presidential executive order to remove, and likely a law or two that need to be amended or repealed in order to change the currency BACK to a precious-metal based currency.... So if he could PLEASE give us some information in hard copy format that supports anything he's saying, maybe we can help him understand THIS. IS. NOT. HAPPENING. 

He just repeats his statement that 'it's happening' and 'executive orders can change'.... He's not engaging with any of the stuff I've said, and it's like talkin to a wind-up-doll. A series of pre-recorded claims or phrases that are rhetorically worthless, like a chanted magic spell to make all the bad stuff like inflation to go away.   
  
He came back recently, pointedly avoided me, but did walk up to and bend the ear of another coworker who used to be married to a pastor.... and that's where things REALLY went off the rails. He went on and on about how 'the government doesn't care for us' and 'its not health care it's UNhealth care', so all the government needs to just go away and it's going to happen and everything will be better and he's had visions that Trump is going to win and there's all these prophecies that says he's going to win and it's going to be wonderful... And would we call him when we can order the gold-backed currency starting next month? 

I have never seen anyone so FIXATED on something like this... So PROUD to believe something like this so completely and have nothing objective to show for it.

euchre,1fgpfqe,"Next, reverse next, and getting stuck","Hi folks, questions from a few hands I played this morning, want to make sure I'm playing these hands correctly and not getting luckier than I should be. Rated \~1850.

  
1. Score is 6 - 4 us. I'm in 1st seat, dealer turns down Ks and I call next holding Js10c Ah10h Kd. First trick I lead Kd, partner takes with Qc, both opponents follow suit. Partner leads 10s back, I play my 10c and it's good, both opponents had to follow again. Third trick I lead Ah, 4th seat is able to trump in with the 9c. 4th trick they lead the Jd and I throw my left on it, which ends up being good and we make our point. Did I do the correct thing by leading the Kd on the first trick, or should I have led the 10c? Were there any errors I made in choosing what card to play?

  
2. Score is 9 - 8 us. I'm dealing and stuck, having turned down Ks. I hold Ac9c 10d 10s Kh. I chose to go with hearts and we ended up making our point. In an ideal world, was I right to assume that if my partner held either black jack, they would have ordered the king? Should I still have gone with clubs anyway?

  
3. Score is 0 - 0. I'm in second seat, with partner having turned down Jc. I hold JdKh AsJs 9c and call hearts round 2. I trump first trick with the Kh and lead 9c, which my partner takes with 10h. Partner leads Qs and 1st seat trumps in with Qh. Leads Ac and I throw the left on it, everyone else follows, making the point. Did I play correctly?

  
4. Score is 1 - 0 us. I'm in first seat and dealer turns down 9c. I hold JsAs Kh Jd9d. I lead the Kh, 2nd takes it with the Ah. Trick two my partner throws the L on and we've made our point. Is Kh the correct first lead or should I have led As?

I guess the overall theme seems to be that I'm unsure when you're supposed to lead low trump on a next call. My gut tells me to do it when you have a green ace and to not do it if you're going to need more help.

the_everything_bubble,1fgpfoq,Trump is no longer trying to win the election,"
The word is out.  Trump is no longer trying to win the election.

It’s very obvious now that Trump is not trying to win the election.

Why else would he go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things he did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let’s be honest.  Trump wants to lose.  Why else would he go on a the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

 He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Why else would he go on a debate stage and refuse to support Poland against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine?

He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Trump knows he’s going to lose but he is using his air time to make a push for another run in the entertainment industry.  Trump will be a consultant in a movie about his political career.

He won’t play himself.  Instead the role of Trump will go to Ric Flair, the ex-professional wrestler known as the “dirtiest wrestler” in the game.

Flair was very popular for his bleached blond hair and carnival barking style.  Thousands of wrestling fans believed his act was real and they adored him much like Trump supporters adore Trump.

Dolly Parton is being courted to star as Stormy Daniels, the American pornographic film actress and former stripper.

Trump’s extras in the movie will be picked in a pecking order with the first opportunities going to the “patriots” who attacked the Capitol.

The secondary roles will go to former MAGAs who were not part of the attack but supported MAGA.

MAGA movie extra hopefuls will have to bring a red MAGA cap to be considered as an extra for the movie: “Trump. He did it his Way.”",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,2,2024-09-14 16:02:47,4,,False,1.0,POLITICS,2024-09-14 12:18:58.790040

Putin's given him root.But if trump doesn't get reelected that messes Putin [up.So](http://up.So) to take the focus off all the malware stuff Putin has trump doing , like becoming a dictator, Project 2025, and letting Putin run the USA by trump proxy - they feed him distracting resource-wasting talking points, and strategies to keep trump in power!Putin and the KGB distract us from their dictatorship proxy hack by having trump say the stupidest most divisive things possible to keep us focusing on the wrong stuff and fighting amongst ourselves. 2 Days ago how many news stations were focusing on Haitians eating cats??? Way too many!Instead, American media and citizens should be focusing on things like trump having legal immunity in government, trump replacing all the electoral college vote counters with his own people, and the supreme court having been replaced with all trump appointees. trump is basically being set up to be a dictator by Putin -- and that's what Putin DOESN'T want us to focus on. If we focus on that we might arrest trump or execute him for treason and that would end Putin's powerplay.

MarkMyWords,1fgp8lu,MMW: Mike Pence will unironically live on as an American hero.,"It’s crazy to say this but he will. No it won’t be because of any policies he pushed forward under the Trump administration or view points he has. Quite honestly they are pretty disturbing.

It’s me due to the fact of simply rejecting the false electors submitted by Trump in hopes to overturn 2020 election is an incredibly pivotal point and significant avoids a huge constitutional crisis. I mean the who “rally” during Jan 6 was centered around applying pressure for Mike Pence to make the decision in favor of Trump. There’s no way to put it otherwise.

He as a republican from trump administration publicly “defying” Trump in name of the constitution is the idealism for American ideals.

Me personally I disagree and despise Pence heavily on policy, but that movement was more significant than any realize and in hindsight would benefit the core values of american democracy. (Assuming Trump loses in 2024 then otherwise they’ll rewrite history and justify Trump’s jan 6 actions which is even more dangerous.)",tycooperaow,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1fgp8lu/mmw_mike_pence_will_unironically_live_on_as_an/,/r/MarkMyWords/comments/1fgp8lu/mmw_mike_pence_will_unironically_live_on_as_an/,5,2024-09-14 15:54:23,0,,False,0.45,None,2024-09-14 12:18:58.790040

sixers,1fgphwu,How does our offensive potential compare to 2019 and 2023? ,"So, I think most people would agree that the two best iterations of the Embiid-era Sixers were in 2019 and 2023. In both of those years, we lost heart-breakingly in a 7 game 2nd round series, where a title run seemed right within our grasps. 

Both of those teams, while immensely talented offensively, had their own fatal flaws. In 2019, we had a juggernaut of a starting 5, but the pieces didn't quite fit. Butler rarely shot 3s, Simmons refused to shoot 3s, and Harris shot plenty of 3s at a miserable percentage. 

In 2023, we had similar but also different issues. Tucker would only shoot from the corners, while Harris once again shot miserably (26%). Boston was glad to sag off or leave them altogether. They dared Harden to finish over Rob Williams at the rim, which he only was successful at when hitting floaters. 

I think this year, our starting lineup has potential to be the most balanced, effective, and diverse offense of the Embiid era. While Martin and Oubre aren't Redick, they have both shown the ability to shoot 40% from 3 over the course of a playoff series, while also being threats cutting / attacking closeouts. 

I think the combination of Maxey and George next to Embiid will lead to the most spaced out court of Emiids career. They are both very diverse co-stars, who can more or less score from anywhere on the court, off-the-dribble as well as off-the-catch. 

How do you guys think these 3 contenders compare? 

**2019:**

- Ben Simmons
- JJ Redick
- Jimmy Butler
- Tobias Harris
- Joel Embiid

**2023:**

- James Harden 
- Tyrese Maxey
- Tobias Harris
- PJ Tucker 
- Joel Embiid

- Tyrese Maxey

AdvLiterateRP,1fgpblb,(fxa) looking for new roleplay partners!,"Hello Reddit! :)

I’m currently searching for some new writing friends :) Roleplaying has been my hobby on and off for over a decade and I love it so much.

I would really like the following things in a roleplay partner:

* At least twenty-three years of age.
* Advanced literate and comfortable writing a few paragraphs per reply.
* Writes in the third person, past tense.
* A fan of brainstorming and working together to create a beautiful story.
* Willing to send over a writing sample (I’m happy to send one back in return).
* Writes on Discord.

I am a fandom girly, I love creating new stories in worlds that I already love. The current fandoms that I’m interested in writing are (in no particular order): A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, Crescent City, The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Stranger Things, The Hunger Games, The 100, Star Wars, Bridgerton and Harry Potter.

I also love other genres. Fantasy is my favorite but I do enjoy mafia/mob, mystery, royalty and historical. I’m not huge on slice of life unless there is a very compelling plot with lots of intricate dynamics.

My favorite tropes to write are; enemies/rivals to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, morally greey male characters, strangers to lovers, power couple, opposites attract, grumpy x sunshine, soul mates/fated mates, slow burn and found family.

My go-to characters are original female characters. I’m interested in playing against other original or canon characters. FxM is my favorite, followed by FxF with the right plot. All characters will be aged 18+.

I would absolutely LOVE to write against Lucien or Eris (ACOTAR), Fenrys (Throne of Glass), Sam Wilson or Bucky Barmes (MCU), Stranger Things (Steve Harrington), The Hunger Games (Finnick Odair), and Poe Dameron (Star Wars).

I do my best to post daily (I normally get reply multiple times a day and I love a good rapidfire session) but I do have a stressful job and other responsibilities. If I won’t be able to respond for about a day or two, I let my partners know. 

I also love OOC chat, whether it’s about our characters or pop culture or animals. 

Please send me a message or a chat if you’re interested and let me know what genre you'd like to write! (Please no 'hey' or 'hey wanna rp' messages,)

Happy roleplaying! :)",allbookedup_,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1fgpblb/fxa_looking_for_new_roleplay_partners/,/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1fgpblb/fxa_looking_for_new_roleplay_partners/,0,2024-09-14 15:58:08,1,,False,1.0,F4M,2024-09-14 12:19:00.284617

ASoIaF/Game of Thrones (**OC x Sansa Stark/Alayne Stone, OC x Cerenna/Myrielle Lannister/Janei Lannister, OC x Desmera Redwyne, OC x Young Cersei, OC x Roslin Frey, OC x Eleanor Mooton, OC x OC Highborn Lady**) So I'm a HUGE fan of ASoIaF, and am a walking encyclopedia for this world, and I have a multitude of OCs for them, so I've been itching to RP in this world for so long! Either set in the distant future, or during the War of the Five Kings, or the Dance of Dragons.
2. Harry Potter RP (**OC x Hermione Granger, OC x OC, OC x Daphne Greengrass, OC x Victoire Weasley, OC x Lily Luna, OC x Marlene McKinnon, OC x Rose Granger)** Also a fan of Harry Potter, and wanting to play my Bones OC in any era! We can play in the Marauder's Era, play across the Golden Trio's Era, or even the future era!
3. Percy Jackson RP - **OC x Drew Tanaka, OC x Katie Gardner, OC x OC,**
4. Walking Dead RP - **OC x Beth Greene, OC x OC, OC x Any Canon**
5. Persona RP -- **Personal favorite**, either set in 3, 4, 5 or an original world that follows the Personal formula
6. Sword Art Online -- Set in Season 1, I'd like to play an OC as we go through a correlational storyline alongside Kirito and Asuna's, Maybe the storylines would intersect! We could also set this in the **Ragnarok Online** Game!
7. Cyberpunk 2077 RP - **V x OC, V x Panam, V x Joytoy**
8. Fallout RP -- **Courier x OC, Courier x Cass**
9. Dragon Age RP -- **Warden x OC, Inquisitor x OC, Hawke x OC**
10. **Euphoria RP -** Maddy x OC, Cassie x OC, Lexi x OC
11. **Grey's Anatomy RP** - OC x Lexie Grey, OC x Jo Wilson - **CRAVING THIS RIGHT NOW**
12. **Post Apocalyptic RP**
13. **Superhero/Mutant RP**
14. Post Apocalyptic Soldier x Scavenger, Post Apocalyptic Soldier x Escaped Serf, Post Apocalyptic Soldier x Sole Survivor

roleplaying,1fgp9ms,(fxa) looking for new roleplay partners!,"Hello Reddit! :)

I’m currently searching for some new writing friends :) Roleplaying has been my hobby on and off for over a decade and I love it so much.

I would really like the following things in a roleplay partner:

* At least twenty-three years of age.
* Advanced literate and comfortable writing a few paragraphs per reply.
* Writes in the third person, past tense.
* A fan of brainstorming and working together to create a beautiful story.
* Willing to send over a writing sample (I’m happy to send one back in return).
* Writes on Discord.

I am a fandom girly, I love creating new stories in worlds that I already love. The current fandoms that I’m interested in writing are (in no particular order): A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, Crescent City, The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Stranger Things, The Hunger Games, The 100, Star Wars, Bridgerton and Harry Potter.

I also love other genres. Fantasy is my favorite but I do enjoy mafia/mob, mystery, royalty and historical. I’m not huge on slice of life unless there is a very compelling plot with lots of intricate dynamics.

My favorite tropes to write are; enemies/rivals to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, morally greey male characters, strangers to lovers, power couple, opposites attract, grumpy x sunshine, soul mates/fated mates, slow burn and found family.

My go-to characters are original female characters. I’m interested in playing against other original or canon characters. FxM is my favorite, followed by FxF with the right plot. All characters will be aged 18+.

I would absolutely LOVE to write against Lucien or Eris (ACOTAR), Fenrys (Throne of Glass), Sam Wilson or Bucky Barmes (MCU), Stranger Things (Steve Harrington), The Hunger Games (Finnick Odair), and Poe Dameron (Star Wars).

I do my best to post daily (I normally get reply multiple times a day and I love a good rapidfire session) but I do have a stressful job and other responsibilities. If I won’t be able to respond for about a day or two, I let my partners know. 

I also love OOC chat, whether it’s about our characters or pop culture or animals. 

Please send me a message or a chat if you’re interested and let me know what genre you'd like to write! (Please no 'hey' or 'hey wanna rp' messages,)

CharlotteDobreYouTube,1fgp9e7,Karma is MY Bitch,"Honestly i wish there was a seperate section for Karma stories, because my stories is about more Karma then petty revenge. (Also this is gonna be huge)

So the story setting is when i was in High School, I had a crush on a guy, lets call him John, who was in my grade. I jokingly told him oneday, that we could date and he took it seriously. So we started meeting after classes and he would drive me around the block with his car. During our conversations, he would often mention how he didn't want anybody to know that we were in a relationship. And honestly this was really common- to keep relationships private. I respected his request and didnt tell anyone about anything. But one of my friend, lets call her Betty, spotted me calling him oneday and she asked me if i was dating him. I told her because I thought she was the ones who can keep a secret. She promised me that nobody will know about this.

The next day while i was in a class, I started getting texts from John accusing me of spreading the news. He was sending me the ugliest texts calling me a bitch. He immediately blocked and unblocked me and my entire conversation disappeared. So basically there was literally no proof or screenshot that showed he agreed with this relationship. I turned to Betty and asked her if she told anyone. She denied and told me ""she doesnt care enough"" to do so. Later, John texts me (again in the most ugly way possible) that I have told Betty and she is spreading it around. I was devastated and started crying. I heard people laughing. My heart dropped. Some of John's female friends who would talk to me regularly , was ignoring me too. But it was quite shady because why would anyone ignore me just because i dated someone. Upon some investigation i got to know , that drunk John confessed to one of his best friend that he was dating me. So the best friend told her entire circle that we were dating and when Betty heard about it, she took the opportunity of confirming the relationship. That's how everybody in my class got to know.

The next few weeks were very hard for me because John had told people how i was only dating him because of his money. (Spoiler alert: I didnt know he was filty rich) He told my friends that i am a golddigger and i need to be taught a lesson. His friends and even a teacher (who he would share everything with) would directly and indirectly call me names. My friends (except my best friend) would ignore me too. Also, i really wanna know why he was calling me a golddigger considering, he just drove me around the block at our first date and never offered me food or drinks. LMAO

I didn't know what to say/do to defend myself. I told friends who were close to me and they believed me. They knew the accusations are false and I could never date to dig some ""fictional"" gold. 

I was in shambles, cried almost every night. The humiliation kept on increasing day by day. Even when i decided to confide to a friend who was close to the bullies, he told me it was my fault because me dating him was a gold-diggerish move and he cannot be seen with me anymore. (mind you, this guy cheated on his gf with a junior)

Anyways months later, the students of my grade decided to host a 3-days event. My entire grade was working as the organization board so i wanted to be a part of it too. And i was. My work was to find some students who would like to volunteer for the event - this was a difficult because nobody wanted to ""volunteer"". I had to knock multiple dms of juniors and invest a good amount of time to make them familiar with their role. When my work was finally done, the Head of the organization board knocked me and told me that he is kicking me out of the organization board. I was dumbfounded and asked him the reason. To which he said ""we dont need you , you can join as a participant"". Throughout the entire conversation he was behaving rude but i didnt really care cause we weren't that close. The next day i told one of my friend who was working closely with the Head, to ask him why he made me work if he wanted to kick me out of the event. 

After a long meeting with the Head, my ""so-called"" friend told me that I can either stay in the organization board but they will not give me my certificate or food on the event or I can leave silently. 

This is where the petty revenge comes. You see, the event they were organizing were only student coordinated. Teachers are not involved because they are considered major buzz kill. If the teachers coordinate the event, there will be many restrictions and it will be over for lovey dovey couples. The event was also kept on weekends. So what did i do next? I went to a group of teachers i considered close and told them everything - including John, the ongoing bullying situation and how they threw me out after my work was done. As expected, they were furious. They let me know that they will look into this matter and shut the entire thing down if the bullying continues.

Few weeks later, the teachers held a meeting and asked them to reinstate me. I could feel the heat in the room because now the teachers are involved and will look into matters more closely then before. And this goes without saying, there were restrictions.

Days later, i got an unexpected message request from John, threatening me to leave the event myself or be raped at school. I was so shocked. Again, i immediately took screenshots and emailed it to my teachers. I sent the screenshot to multiple friends and told them ""if something happens to me you know who did it"". I didnt feel safe anymore. Especially because i walked to and from my home, alone most of the time. 

Later the teachers called me for a meeting and they asked me to either trust them on this or back out of the event. I said I will never back out of the event because if i dont stand my ground they will keep bullying me. The teachers told me that they are extremely sorry for what happened and will make sure this never happens again. Sure enough, John never contacted me again. LOL

The event day comes, I worked all alone, nobody bothered talking to me. Some kind hearted people still acknowledged my existence while others didn't. I could feel John and his friends laughing at me. His best friend, lets call him, Harry, would call me a ""slut"" and ""bitch"" in the middle of the event while i was working. I felt terrible but kept quiet and did my job. It was hell. 

On the last day of the event, there was a small after-party. I went there and had no date but one of my junior asked me to dance with him. While i was dancing, John came up to me - all drunk and high and whispered in my ears how  he will ruin my happiness. Luckily his friends pulled him out of the situation and i just went for dinner. After the party, i went home. 

(Before we go to the next paragraph, i need y'all to know that the continuous bullying did affect me very badly. I was unresponsive when asked a question by my parents. Spent most of my time skipping classes and sleeping. I buried my face in my phone to reduce the online/offline stress i was getting. In all, i was very depressed.)

The next day i went to school and immediately knew something was wrong. I didnt ask anyone but then heard a teacher say how ""John had a tragic TRAGIC accident after last night's party""
(He was drunk-driving and his car had a major crash). The teachers said his condition was very critical. 

Ain't that just Karma? Lol

I went home that day, smiling, maybe after months. I looked up in the sky and knew God was looking over me. I am not the one who would celebrate such tragedy but forgive me because this one, i did. 
I didn't care if he survived or died but whatever he felt that time, he deserved it. 

Whats more amusing is - Karma hit both Betty and Harry too(hard!!!)- but that is the story for another day. 

Thank you so much for reading the story. It was traumatizing but i healed and became a better person as the time passed. I have better friends now who has my back no matter what and would not abandon me on baseless accusations. They'd rather stay and educate me on stuff i dont know and I wholeheartedly appreciate that.

Roleplay,1fgorjv,(F4A) PARTNER SEARCH!,"
Hi, all! I’m Eunoia, a 20something roleplayer itching to write! I’m a huge lover of fantasy, fandoms, various things (except sci-fi). For the various fandoms, I’m absolute down for OC x CC and OCxOC. However, there is a select few fandoms I would be willing to do CCxCC (which I’ll list down below!)

Onto the fandoms!

	1.	AOT/SNK (This is one where I’d love to write a canon character, Hange! The ship in particular is LeviHan!)
	2.	Demon Slayer! I love this universe and have a very detailed Hashira OC! I’d love to do OCxOC for this! Two hashiras fighting for their life with a delicious slowburn? Sign me up!
	3.	MHA! This one might take me a while but I’d love to craft up a story for this one! I would love to try Deku or Ochako.
	4.	ASOIAF! Oh. My. God. Don’t get me started on how much I love this fandom! I have a myriad of OCs I’d love to play (and don’t worry, they’re not all Targ centric. I love variety!)
	5.	5. PJO! An old time classic that I love.
	6.	Harry Potter! HATE JKR. I wouldn’t mind writing himself.
	7.	ATLA! Yes, I have an Avatar OC. Sue me.
	8.	Stranger Things! The character I have for this one is … heavy. If you’re uncomfortable with heavy topics, I don’t suggest this one.
	9.	Marvel! Listen, who doesn’t love Marvel? I have a bunch of OCs for this, male and female.
	10.	The Hunger Games.
	11.	Inuyasha.
	12.	Outerbanks.
	13.	Bridgerton.

Now that the fandoms are out of the way —- I love fantasy! Maybe you’re the princess’ beloved knight, maybe there’s an arranged marriage! Maybe we’re on a quest to save the world, or we’re superheroes! I’m pretty open, throw your plots at me and we’ll discuss.

Now, onto some simple rules!

A few key notes ——

	1.	I am twenty years old, and would like you to be close to or older than that.
	2.	Please, put some effort into your intro if you message me!
	3.	I’m advanced literate, around five paragraphs more or less a reply. This can vary!
	4.	My main method of writing is in Discord. It’s very organized!
	5.	Please be communicative! We all hate ghosting round these parts.

KamalaHarris,1fgor9w,Harris campaign launches $3M effort on Spanish-language radio,"The Harris campaign plans to roll out a $3 million dollar Spanish-language radio effort and organizing push aimed at Latino voters in battleground states as Hispanic Heritage Month kicks off.

The radio push includes an investment into Spanish-language radio stations, supporting existing pushes on bilingual television. According to the release, 96% of Latinos listen to the radio weekly.

This effort will also include a bilingual phone banking program, the strengthening of a messenger program that seeks to educate Latino communities about the election and digital content from Latino activists and organizers about reproductive freedom.

Vice President Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), are planning to attend events, such as baseball games, boxing matches and Mexican Independence Day festivities, in key states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as part of the push.

Harris also plans to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual conference on Sept. 18. Her agenda focuses on building up middle-class Latino families, the press release said.

“Latinos con Harris-Walz” will hold events alongside Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) in Michigan. Garcia plans to travel to Minnesota on Sunday in celebration of Mexican Independence Day.

MeetNewPeopleHere,1fgooja,[34/M] London for new friends. Open to voice chats too.,"Hello there, I'm looking to increase my friends circle. Someone open to any of the following, food markets, arcades, cafe hopping, long walks,  2for1 movies, 2for1 art gallery/ museum exhibitions, theatre shows/plays/musicals, heavy metal concerts etc.

A little about me: INFJ, work full time (mostly from home) within an STEM career. Shy,  introverted (unless I'm comfortable with you then I can be chatty and come off as an extrovert), empathetic and family orientated. I can be silly, cheeky and sassy at times too. 

I am in a long distance relationship hence looking for a strictly platonic close friend. I don't mind if you are single or in a relationship too.

My interests: 

• MASSIVE FOODIE (Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese mostly and open to trying new cuisines) I'm the go to person to find a nice food spot 😎

• Self care via gym, spa days and retail therapy

• Video gaming (mostly on PS5 and Steamdeck) Though I do have a Switch too. BG3, God of War, Hades, EAFC/FIFA, Call of Duty, Stardew Valley, Pokémon and many others. Open to finding an online co op gaming buddy!

• Genuinely listen to all types of music. I have quite a few heavy metal concerts coming up in the next couple of months and and could have spare tickets to a couple!

• Movie marathons. LOTR, Harry Potter, DC, Marvel, Studio Ghibli, Disney, psychological thrillers, mystery, horror, martial arts, sci fi, documentaries, crime etc.

• Anime. Massive One Piece fan. Tokyo Ghoul, Attack on Titan, Death Note, Code Geass, Bleach,  Naruto, Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen. Usually go to comic con once or twice a year. 

• Theatre shows, plays and musicals

• Museum and gallery exhibitions. I have a 2for1 art fund pass which is itching to be used up more regularly.

• Binging Kdramas, if you need any Kdrama recommendations. Holla

worldbuilding,1fgojja,Clueless! How to start my first world? ,"Watsup. This is my first time in this subreddit.

After playing games and watching movies/shows my whole life I came to a realization. I can honestly say that one of my favorite things to do is experience fictional worlds that other people have made.

Things like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Dune, Batman, Attack on Titan, Eighty Six, and most recently Cyberpunk Edgerunners/2077 have always been really cool to me. Something about an alternate reality with its own complexities and power struggles different to ours grabs my attention.

Specifically in Cyberpunk, I’ve really grown attached to it for a few reasons.

1) The ability to install mech gear and customize yourself to become stronger. But, this form of customization isn’t just for the rich, it’s also utilized amongst the poor, giving everyone a somewhat equal playing field.
2) You don’t necessarily know who the enemy is. Is it the gangs or the corporations they’re up against? It’s hard to tell and is mostly defendant on your own perspective in the world. Mothers grow up hopping their children climb the corporate lady while corpos are really the ones enabling all of the hardships in Night City.
3) The environment and atmosphere are still somewhat realistic and relatable. Everything happening is something that I could potentially see becoming a reality, therefore it grips me a little stronger. 

So after coming up with this little thesis lol, I guess my question is how do I start to create my own world. I’ve never considered this before nor am I an experienced author or anything like that. Do people start with story board outlines, or do you just kind of start writing. Is something like this even feasible for a guy (23M btw) who has no writing experience besides English 401 in college lol. 

Obviously unrealistic, but the goal would be to have my world adapted into some form of media. Especially in the anime world, you always hear stories of this. Example a bad writer and bad artist come up with an amazing world and story line, and then eventually they get a big break and hone their individual skills later on. 

What should my first step be, what method should I go about in creating my world, and do you have any video suggestions or books/movies to work off of? Obviously the real answer will be to just start, but a little direction would be nice!

Thanks!

Trong chương trình giáo dục phổ thông 2006 của Bộ GD-ĐT, sách Tin học lớp 11 tập trung vào ngôn ngữ lập trình, với Pascal là ngôn ngữ được lựa chọn để giảng dạy cho học sinh.

Sách giới thiệu cho học sinh những khái niệm cơ bản cùng với những ví dụ Pascal song song với C++.

**Ngôn ngữ lập trình Pascal**

[Niklaus Wirth](https://preview.redd.it/nw73w8tmksod1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ba39a6fcf813ff9767aaf4af7c284788ec4064f)

Thiết kế bởi: Niklaus Wirth (1934-2024)

Xuất hiện lần đầu: 1970

Mẫu hình lập trình: lập trình mệnh lệnh, lập trình cấu trúc

Kiểm tra kiểu: static, strong, safe

Phần mở rộng tệp tin: .pp, .pas, .inc

Ảnh hưởng bởi: ALGOL W, Simula 67

Ảnh hưởng tới: Ada, Component Pascal, C#, Java,  Object Pascal,…

Các phương ngữ: Delphi, Turbo Pascal, UCSD Pascal

**Lịch sử ngôn ngữ:**

**Giới thiệu chung**

Pascal là ngôn ngữ lập trình mệnh lệnh, thủ tục được Niklaus Writh thiết kế như một ngôn ngữ nhỏ, hiệu quả nhằm khuyến khích các hoạt động lập trình tốt bằng cách sử dụng lập trình có cấu trúc và cấu trúc dữ liệu. Ngôn ngữ được đặt tên theo nhà toán học, triết học vật lí người Pháp Blaise Pascal.

[Blaise Pascal \(1623-1662\)](https://preview.redd.it/qidckks3nsod1.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ac0846328482f747c7a9e2a3f1d7b67040c94a)

**Ra đời**

https://preview.redd.it/mxgm1x4hmsod1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2361bad045e37b442ce3ef563e8b951634b17ca4

Phần lớn thiết kế các ngôn ngữ lập trình đâu tiên có thể bắt nguồn từ ALGOL 60 (**ALGO**rithmic **L**anguage 1960). ALGOL được phát triển trong những năm 1950 với mục tiêu rõ ràng là có thể mô tả rõ ràng các thuật toán . Nó bao gồm một số tính năng cho lập trình có cấu trúc vẫn phổ biến trong các ngôn ngữ cho đến ngày nay.

https://preview.redd.it/0tlnthjimsod1.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49bab33f4dadbf5da04e6dd292050794ff8f9db

Ngay sau khi ra mắt, năm 1962 Wirth bắt đầu làm luận án với Helmut Weber về ngôn ngữ lập trình Euler, một ngôn ngữ dựa trên cú pháp của ALGOL và nhiều khái niệm nhưng không phải là một ngôn ngữ phái sinh. Mục tiêu chính của nó là thêm các danh sách và kiểu động, cho phép nó được sử dụng trong các vai trò tương tự như Lisp . Ngôn ngữ này được xuất bản vào năm 1965.

Vào thời gian này, một số vấn đề của ALGOL đã được xác định, đặc biệt là thiếu một hệ thống chuỗi tiêu chuẩn hóa. Nhóm được giao nhiệm vụ duy trì ngôn ngữ đã bắt đầu thực hiện ALGOL X để xác định các cải tiến, kêu gọi đệ trình. Wirth và Tony Hoare đã thêm chuỗi và làm mới một số cú pháp. Các nỗ lực của ALGOL X làm cho ngôn ngữ ngày càng phức tạp hơn ALGOL 68. Sự phức tạp của ngôn ngữ này dẫn đến khó khăn đáng kể trong việc tạo ra các trình biên dịch hiệu suất cao, và nó không được sử dụng rộng rãi trong ngành. Do đó, Wirth đã viết một trình biên dịch cho ngôn ngữ máy tính, được gọi là ALGOL W.

**Cho đến Pascal**

Pascal là thành quả từ ALGOL X với nhiều cải tiến hiệu quả biên dịch, thời gian chạy và hữu ích trong việc giảng dạy lập trình cấu trúc cho học sinh. Một thế hệ sinh viên đã sử dụng Pascal như một ngôn ngữ vỡ lòng trong các chương trình đại học đại cương

https://preview.redd.it/klbb2idlmsod1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=5170a1247af8cb43bfa1d9ede5058012f3b262c2

khác nhau. Một nền tảng quan trọng đó là Apple II, nơi mà nó được sử dụng rộng rãi. Điều này dẫn đến việc sử dụng Pascal trở thành ngôn ngữ cấp cao chính được sử dụng để phát triển trong Apple Lisa, và sau đó, Macintosh. Các bộ phận của hệ điều hành Macintosh ban đầu được dịch sang ngôn ngữ lắp ráp Motorola 68000 từ các nguồn Pascal.

Hệ thống sắp xếp chữ TeX của Donald E. Knuth được viết bằng WEB, hệ thống lập trình biết chữ gốc, dựa trên DEC PDP-10 Pascal, trong khi các ứng dụng như Total Commander, Skype và Macromedia Captivate được viết bằng Delphi (Object Pascal). Apollo Computer đã sử dụng Pascal làm ngôn ngữ lập trình hệ thống cho các hệ điều hành của nó bắt đầu từ năm 1980.

[Giao diện phần mềm Total Commander](https://preview.redd.it/a62blu3nmsod1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c5d47a0bdcc9feef762fde8dc6f4151cbd39d48)

Pascal trở nên rất thành công trong những năm 1970, đặc biệt là trên thị trường máy tính mini đang phát triển mạnh. Các trình biên dịch cho ngôn ngữ này cũng có sẵn cho nhiều máy vi tính khi lĩnh vực này xuất hiện vào cuối những năm 1970. Nó đã được sử dụng rộng rãi như một ngôn ngữ giảng dạy trong các khóa học lập trình cấp đại học vào những năm 1980, và cũng được sử dụng trong cài đặt sản xuất để viết phần mềm thương mại trong cùng thời kỳ. Nó bị ngôn ngữ lập trình C thay thế vào cuối những năm 1980 và đầu những năm 1990 khi các hệ thống dựa trên UNIX trở nên phổ biến, và đặc biệt là với sự ra đời của C++.

program Hello;

begin

writeln ('Hello, world.');

end.

**Tại Việt Nam**

Pascal là ngôn ngữ được giảng dạy trong chương trình giảng dạy tại Việt Nam. Trong những năm qua, có nhiều ý kiến đề xuất cần thay đổi ngôn ngữ giảng dạy để phù hợp với xu thế chung của thế giới.  Do đó, trên tinh thần loại bỏ Pascal khỏi chương trình Tin học 11, Bộ GD&ĐT cho biết cơ sở giáo dục có thể lựa chọn giảng dạy các ngôn ngữ lập trình có tính cập nhật, hiện đại, được dạy trong trường phổ thông nhiều nước như Python, C, C++…

Theo hướng dẫn, các phần lý thuyết, thực hành của môn Tin học 11 sau khi điều chỉnh sẽ dựa trên ngôn ngữ lập trình do trường lựa chọn giảng dạy.

*Mặc dù các bộ sách hiện tại sử dụng Python làm ngôn ngữ giảng dạy nhưng Pascal chắc chắn vẫn sẽ là những kỉ niệm về những dòng code trên giấy hay là trên máy tính.*",daulser,https://www.reddit.com/r/TroChuyenLinhTinh/comments/1fgozxk/ngôn_ngữ_lập_trình_có_thể_bạn_từng_học_pascal/,/r/TroChuyenLinhTinh/comments/1fgozxk/ngôn_ngữ_lập_trình_có_thể_bạn_từng_học_pascal/,1,2024-09-14 15:43:39,5,,False,1.0,tâm sự,2024-09-14 12:19:01.560297

tipofmytongue,1fgopmp,[TOMT] [MOVIE/TOYS] CG 3D movie from early 2000s about a secret agent. Agent X? Mr x? ,"
This has been bugging me for 10+ years and I finally figured to ask here. My best memory was a 3d animated movie about an agent who wore a black orange diving-like suit. He was called Mr x or agent x? Super x? Something cliche for kids. I remember the bad guy vividly, he was bald but with a grey pony tail and a robot eye and purple pants. I had maybe one toy from this but I do remember that McDonald’s (at least in Europe early 2000) had a lineup for a bit. I had the bad guy from there for sure. I was obsessed when I was real young. 

Every 2-3 years I try to google it and I’ve never found a thing. This time around I’ll just ask here. THANKS!!!!

tifu,1fgoma5,TIFU by gas bombing my math tutor,"This happened a week ago, and I still can’t get over it.

I’ve been looking for a good math tutor for a while now, and I finally found one. Like, a tutor that’s actually patient, understanding and teaches the why rather than just the how. 

The only problem is I get anxious in front of guys. Doesn’t matter if I’m attracted to them or not, I just do. Which is fine, but when paired with my ibs - it’s just not a good combo.

Cut to our class. He’s explaining something about calculus or some shit, I don’t fucking know because all I’m focused on is holding it in. I had McDonalds like an hour before class, and of course the fact that he’s male wasn’t helping either. At that moment I was paralyzed.

Then I had an epiphany - I remembered watching this one meme about hiding your farts in class. “If I make a loud noise and fart at the same time, I’ll be good”, I thought to myself. No, I didn’t think to “mute the call” or “excuse myself for the bathroom”. Logic? Reasoning? That’s for pussies. So I sit there, psyching myself up, thinking of all the motivational speakers I scroll past on TikTok. 

“No time like the present” I think to myself before coughing as loud as humanly possible. My tutor instantly stops in the middle of explaining whatever he was explaining. We make eye contact. Time freezes. Silence.

As I stare into his soul I let out the biggest, loudest, most diabolical fart I’ve ever heard in my life. Fuck a car engine, Henry Ford came back from the dead to pat me on the back for doing his invention justice. That shit dropped like Hiroshima and revved for about 15 seconds like a ferrari on adderall. I still have hearing damage from that night man. That shit got me fucked up.

After all the commotion ends my tutor cracks a smile right before I immediately leave the session. Best believe I wasn’t sticking around to find out if he smelt it all the way in Dubai or wherever he’s at. 

The problem is though, like I didn’t embarrass myself enough already, I realized not soon afterwards how it must’ve looked like from his perspective. From his eyes he was just explaining a topic passionately before the girl he was teaching interrupts him with a cough, farts, then promptly leaves. I wanna die.

TLDR: My poor math tutor got ass blasted to the nth dimension. I wanna die I wanna die I wanna die",No_Lavishness_3910,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fgoma5/tifu_by_gas_bombing_my_math_tutor/,/r/tifu/comments/1fgoma5/tifu_by_gas_bombing_my_math_tutor/,12,2024-09-14 15:26:48,36,,False,0.87,M,2024-09-14 12:19:01.560297

FutureWhatIf,1fgog1q,FWI Challenge: Turn Donald Trump into Frank Underwood from House of Cards,"This was inspired by numerous comments by Democrats fearing that if Trump wins, he will end Democracy, the Netflix TV show House of Cards, and a conversation with my father (who told he he's seen House of Cards).

Disclaimer: Before you all take to the comments thinking I'm a MAGA supporter and demanding I delete my profile or go back to my echo-chamber, let me clarify that I do NOT support Trump in any way. I think the way he conducted himself during his time in office was abhorrent and that he is unfit to run this country. 

At this point, if Trump wins, the only way he'd really end democracy (in spite of saying he's distanced himself from Project 2025 and insisting he does not support it) is if he pretty much turns into Frank Underwood from House of Cards. The only question I have is, ""How exactly would he DO that sort of thing?""

So let's set the scene: Trump has won the 2024 US Presidential Election. During his inauguration speech, he shows his true colors, completely backtracks on ANYTHING he said during his campaign trail, admits that he lied about distancing himself from Project 2025, and proceeds to do EXACTLY what the Democratic Party feared he'd do.

I issue you the following challenge: Turn Trump into a real life Frank Underwood. Create a plausible scenario where Trump becomes the tyrannical dictator the Democrats were so scared he'd become despite the US Constitution's checks and balances.

AfricaVoice,1fgnvk1,"Biden to make first Africa visit with Angola trip in coming weeks, sources say. ","[Link](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/us/2024/09/13/biden-to-make-first-africa-visit-with-angola-trip-in-coming-weeks-sources-say/)



President Joe Biden is planning a trip to Angola in the coming weeks, fulfilling a promise that would make him the first US head of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa since Barack Obama in 2015, three sources told Reuters.

The trip, which is being finalised, is likely to occur after the UN General Assembly meeting in September and before the November 5 presidential election, one source said.

The White House declined to comment to Reuters on the trip plans.

Mr Biden had hoped to visit Angola late last year but the trip was postponed after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October.

Mr Biden has pledged closer US partnership with democracies on the African continent, as China invests heavily in the region.

The Democratic President hosted Angolan President Joao Lourenco at the White House last November and raised the prospect of a visit during their Oval Office meeting. In May, he said he planned to make an official visit to Africa in February if he won the US presidential election.

Mr Biden would be the first US president to visit the oil- and resource-rich African country, one of the sources said, following a first visit by a US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, in September 2023.

President Joe Biden and African leaders arrive for a family photo during the US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022. AP

Keen to counter China's investments in Africa, the US has been supporting a project that links resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo to Angola's Lobito port by rail to bypass road congestion on the copper and cobalt route.

Mr Biden, who took office in 2021, has faced some criticism for not visiting the African continent earlier in his term after hosting a US-African leaders summit in Washington in December 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Africa in 2023, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken did this year.

Mr Biden's trip would come weeks before a US presidential election that remains tight, with recent polls showing Democratic candidate Ms Harris tied with her Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, whose derogatory reference to African nations continues to reverberate in African diplomatic circles.

u_Every-Animator-4245,1fgnlty,"Chicago, Boeing, and McDonald's","Chicago, Boeing, and McDonald's

The Kids in Chicago can't read and write at grade level. The Teachers want 50 Billion. Boeing can't keep their products from falling apart. The workers are on strike for 40% pay increases. Burger flippers expect $20/Hour.

This is what you get when they push EQUITY over MERIT. You get a CRAP 'Product'.

PikaNetwork,1fgnjj7,A tale of an unknown player,"I came from pika, as a F2P player  
It's actually quite good ngl, aside for the fact that the server takes SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long to tick, that a watermelon takes an entire 1/4th of an irl day  
Now I am literally just the guy who has owned the entire watermelon economy, having the largest lava powered furnace.  
  
I literally have a McDonalds level delivery system.  
Drop your cobblestone or glass, the machine will immediately give you it's output respectively.  
  
1$ sell for cobble, 2$ buy for stone  
1$ sell for sand, 2$ buy for glass.  
  
Which means, if you sell your stuff, then buy, you just spent 1$ for an instant cook by me.  
It was the cheapest in the server.  
  
Sell cobble, Droppers Activates and pushes items upwards, Inserts Cooked stuff for customer to buy.  
The item would go into the mega furnace down below.  
  
I sold watermelons as a side, 1$ each.  
  
Despite the technology, I kinda just didn't get that much money. I left the server after I felt burnout.  
I was one of the builders of a city for a guy, a road builder. Felt sad I could not say goodbye one last time to that guy with back issues.  


I had a guy who gave me a villager and we became good neighbor buds.  
My initial goal was: Build a prospering village where the villagers were free and not slaves. The lag was not enjoyable.

I left with probably 1000$, I didn't care much of the dollars, I cared for the roads. Yet again, I felt nothing but emptiness after building much.

I wanted to relive that one time, when I made cobblehuts into bricks of stone in single-multiplayer and people would pass by and see it's marvel.",Inderastein,https://www.reddit.com/r/PikaNetwork/comments/1fgnjj7/a_tale_of_an_unknown_player/,/r/PikaNetwork/comments/1fgnjj7/a_tale_of_an_unknown_player/,0,2024-09-14 14:38:31,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:19:01.560297
ItaliaCareerAdvice,1fgnh65,Licenziato,"Ciao a tutti. Ieri mi è stato comunicato che durante il periodo di prova la Coop, dove ho fatto il banconista per praticamente 3 giorni, ha deciso di rescindere il mio contratto. Sono un po' deluso e amareggiato, da me stesso in primis, perché so di essere stato poco maturo e di essermi comportato in maniera indolente, e la responsabile mi ha detto che è a causa di una mancante predisposizione al lavoro e al contatto con il pubblico. Io come unica esperienza lavorativa ho 3 mesi al McDonald's, che ho abbandonato perché l'ambiente di lavoro era abbastanza tossico (avevo paura mi picchiassero a un certo punto, ora con il senno di poi mi sarei fatto più cazzi miei e avrei continuato a lavorarci, anche se quando ho chiesto per il rinnovo del contratto, il gestore mi aveva detto che lui non me lo avrebbe rinnovato, ma in teoria potevo passare attraverso l'agenzia interinale per il quale prestavo servizio in somministrazione), e anche lì ricordo di essermi comportato in maniera a volte spocchiosa ma tutto sommato le cose andavano bene. Sono comunque una persona ben educata e disposta a servire. Io l'impegno nel lavoro l'ho sempre profuso, però mi mancano le capacità. E niente, a voi è mai capitato di essere stati licenziati? Come avete reagito? Io in questo momento mi sto facendo un esame di coscienza, non aiuta il fatto che io mi senta molto perso e confuso in questo periodo della mia vita (ho 23 anni), senza una direzione e vedermi fallire anche in quelli che dovrebbero essere lavoretti mentre tento di capire cosa fare nella mia vita (a dire il vero il lavoro del banconista richiede più manualità di quanto avessi mai potuto pensare) mi impaurisce, soprattutto pensare di non essere tagliato per il lavoro a contatto con il pubblico, dato che stavo valutando di diventare infermiere. Tutto sommato sto bene però, il lavoro non mi piaceva ma mi dispiace di non aver dato il mio meglio.

PoliticsVermont,1fgmzqj,"Proven Rapist Trump is once again using his racist rhetoric to stoke social unrest and political violence. Phil Scott and John Rodgers' freely chosen GOP/VTGOP made special dispensation for the proven rapist so they could support him publicly, loudly, and proudly. Vote better, Vermont, vote better.","So why is this point about Trump being a proven rapist so important? Well, IT'S RAPE, and that should be enough, right?

And because it's a character trait that has become the guiding post for Trump and his followers. Rapists rape for the power. It is a violent assault fully intended to give the rapist absolute authority over the victims.

One need look no further than North Korea to see what the proven rapist Trump's vision for our United States is ... and the Republican Party is salivating all over themselves to help the proven rapist Trump achieve his dream.

The rapist thing is important because it is a character trait and extends beyond his need to dominate and control just women and girls.

Don't be shy about this rapist Trump thing. Trump believes he can grab your daughter by the pussy or your mom or your wife or your sister or aunt or grandmother all because Trump believes his (alleged) wealth and celebrity give him that privilege. [He restated this just a year and a half ago](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-deposition-doubles-access-hollywood-remarks-grabbing-women/story?id=99107636) (the jury heard him loud and clear - why won't you?).

*(trigger warning: the following court decisions contain extremely graphic and blunt descriptions of rape)*

""Consequently, the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused - indeed, raped - Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case."" See page 13 of the Judge's decision ... [https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790/gov.uscourts.nysd.543790.252.0.pdf)

Putin's given him root.But if trump doesn't get reelected that messes Putin [up.So](http://up.So) to take the focus off all the malware stuff Putin has trump doing , like becoming a dictator, Project 2025, and letting Putin run the USA by trump proxy - they feed him distracting resource-wasting talking points, and strategies to keep trump in power!Putin and the KGB distract us from their dictatorship proxy hack by having trump say the stupidest most divisive things possible to keep us focusing on the wrong stuff and fighting amongst ourselves. 2 Days ago how many news stations were focusing on Haitians eating cats??? Way too many!Instead, American media and citizens should be focusing on things like trump having legal immunity in government, trump replacing all the electoral college vote counters with his own people, and the supreme court having been replaced with all trump appointees. trump is basically being set up to be a dictator by Putin -- and that's what Putin DOESN'T want us to focus on. If we focus on that we might arrest trump or execute him for treason and that would end Putin's powerplay. So every time trump starts to lose political power --the KGB picks up their encrypted bat phone and tells trump stupid distracting things to say and do to keep us focused on the wrong stuff and divided --""Tell them Kamala is not Black!""""Tell them Haitians are eating Dogs!""""Tell them Mexicans are Cannibals!""""Tell them Public schools are chopping off Boys Penises"" ""Tell them you won the debate! It was the best debate ever!""""Tell them Jews are replacing them!""If you know how hacking works, you keep the anti-virus people focusing on the wrong stuff so they're not aware of the hacking at all. And, of course, you give your Malware root (Presidential Immunity)!So the stupider the garbage trump spews - the more sinister the stuff Putin's doing to us behind the scenes! Haitians are eating cats??? If trump keeps losing power and his chances of getting re-elected keep dwindling Putin's probably going to start throwing popular Democrats out of windows or the usual Russian free speech stuff. The malware must be reinstalled! -- Distract Distract Distract! Install! Install! Install!Right now trump's encrypted KGB phone is lighting up like a firecracker! Putin's losing his proxy!We have been hacked Bigly though make no mistake!trump says he won the election??? Kamala cackles? Walz didn't really carry a weapon in the War???

PresidentialElection,1fgodbm,Kamala surprised me ,"On the September 10th debate I was honestly kind of shocked by Kamala's performance. At her rallys and speeches previous to the debate. She kind of seemed  off? A lot of her speeches contain ""poking"" at trump and his policys. Kinda saying ""Were better. Vote for me'"". I'm not trying to say she didn't explain her policys or her views on certain things. She did and she did what was expected to do. Simply explain to her supporters what she has planned and what can happen if she gets into office. Besides the point, her rallys were pretty much on par with what we expected. Back to the debate. It seems like she saved and planned everything very well for the debate. She kept her composure *with some exceptions*, stated the differences between her and Trump's policy's, She directed mostly everything she said to us the people. It's was a very solid performance for Kamala. I hope there's a second debate so we can see if shes consistent.

KamalaHarris,1fgo3e7,What’s the best way forward for Kamala’s campaign?,"The debate was an unquestionable win.

The ABC interview after that garnered more mixed views.

It’s nowhere near as bad as republicans are painting it out to be (I saw their commentary before I saw the interview, expected much worse)

Their bar is sky high for Kamala, but literally non-existent for Trump. Main thing they had against her was her lack of clear policies. 

But that line fell out the window when their candidate, who had FOUR (4) years to prepare said he had “concepts of a plan” for healthcare, no inflation plan, no childcare cost plan. But immigrants are eating dogs and geese though.

It’s very obvious to me the fearmongering on their end will increase as the election comes close.

I’m just wondering how Kamala and her team should move going forward. 

More interviews? Adversarial ones? She will definitely need to step away from the politician, canned speeches if that’s the case. 

Walz does that very well: repeats similar points, but switches it up often and keeps it natural (vs feeling rehearsed). Buttigieg too, he repeats himself a lot but people seem to have less of an issue with it because he’s more confident imo, looks interviewers in the eyes, less hesitant in choosing words etc.

burlington,1fgny0h,MAGA ,"Out of curiosity why does everyone here hate the fact that some people are out expressing their free speech in support of the obviously opposed candidate in this state? 

I’m not supporting Trump OR Kamala but I just don’t understand how it benefits anybody to trash talk the people who support either candidate instead of attempting to have a civil discourse and respect each others personal political opinion. 

Obviously if there are people causing a disturbance while out trying to support their candidate I don’t condone that if it’s impeding on others going about their day. 

But seriously I think both sides could learn a thing or two from each other and I think we should all look at each other as humans regardless of political standing. 

Again this post is just out of curiosity on why there is so much animosity instead of respect regardless of if you disagree or not.

AfricaVoice,1fgnvk1,"Biden to make first Africa visit with Angola trip in coming weeks, sources say. ","[Link](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/us/2024/09/13/biden-to-make-first-africa-visit-with-angola-trip-in-coming-weeks-sources-say/)



President Joe Biden is planning a trip to Angola in the coming weeks, fulfilling a promise that would make him the first US head of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa since Barack Obama in 2015, three sources told Reuters.

The trip, which is being finalised, is likely to occur after the UN General Assembly meeting in September and before the November 5 presidential election, one source said.

The White House declined to comment to Reuters on the trip plans.

Mr Biden had hoped to visit Angola late last year but the trip was postponed after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October.

Mr Biden has pledged closer US partnership with democracies on the African continent, as China invests heavily in the region.

The Democratic President hosted Angolan President Joao Lourenco at the White House last November and raised the prospect of a visit during their Oval Office meeting. In May, he said he planned to make an official visit to Africa in February if he won the US presidential election.

Mr Biden would be the first US president to visit the oil- and resource-rich African country, one of the sources said, following a first visit by a US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, in September 2023.

Keen to counter China's investments in Africa, the US has been supporting a project that links resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo to Angola's Lobito port by rail to bypass road congestion on the copper and cobalt route.

Mr Biden, who took office in 2021, has faced some criticism for not visiting the African continent earlier in his term after hosting a US-African leaders summit in Washington in December 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Africa in 2023, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken did this year.

Mr Biden's trip would come weeks before a US presidential election that remains tight, with recent polls showing Democratic candidate Ms Harris tied with her Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, whose derogatory reference to African nations continues to reverberate in African diplomatic circles.

AmericanPolitics,1fgnkpx,"After the woke movement, do you feel more divided or less? ","I’m a liberal democrat. I’ll be voting for Kamala, but the woke movement personally has turned me off sooo much from views I used to have before. I still believe we should have universal healthcare, still want equity and equality, but I seriously roll my eyes and avoid so many people I used to admire before.

Also as a BLM ally, I somehow find myself distancing myself from that. It feels like anything I do as a non black person is getting constantly judged/ or I’m doing something wrong. It has become like a reason for bullys to bully people who are literally just minding their own business, living life and trying to give back/be nice when they can.

I hate how weaponized everything has become since 2020. It might be more of a mental thing for me, but I’ve internalized a lot of online debates and it disgusts me now the way I end up reasoning when it comes to politics.

I also feel myself withdrawing and becoming apathetic and less empathetic. Is it maybe because I’m becoming older?

Just wondering if many other people relate to what I’m saying. I don’t talk about this with family, at work, and try to avoid the topic with friends because it’s so unpleasant.

HeatherCoxRichardson,1fgniyw,"September 14, 2024","After bomb threats today, officials had to evacuate two elementary schools in Springfield, Ohio, and move the students to a different location. They had to close a middle school altogether. This is the second day bomb threats have closed schools and public buildings after MAGA Republicans have spread the lie that Haitian immigrants there have been eating white people's pets. Haitian immigrants, who were welcomed to Springfield by officials eager to revitalize the city and who are there legally, say they are afraid. 

Hunter Walker and Josh Kovensky of *Talking Points Memo* today explained where the lie had come from and how it had spread. More than two months ago, they wrote, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, who is Trump’s vice presidential running mate, began to speak about Springfield at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, trying to tie rising housing prices to immigrants. The next day, at the National Conservatism conference, Vance accused “illegals” of overwhelming the city. 

On August 10, about a dozen neo-Nazis of the “Blood Tribe” organization showed up in Springfield, where one of their leaders said the city had been taken over by “degenerate third worlders” and blamed the Jews for the influx of migrants. The neo-Nazis stayed and, on August 27, showed up at a meeting of the city council, where their leader threatened council members. On September 1, another white supremacist group, Patriot Front, held its own “protest to the mass influx of unassimilable Haitian migrants” in the city. Right-wing social media posters pushed the story, usually with “witnesses” to events in the city coming from elsewhere.

In late August, posting in a private Facebook group, a resident said they had heard that Haitian immigrants had butchered a neighbor’s cat for food. Vance reposted that rumor to attack Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, on whom he is trying to hang undocumented immigration although it was Trump who convinced Republicans to kill a strong bipartisan border bill this spring. Springfield police and the city manager told news outlets there was no truth to the rumors.  

Nonetheless, on September 10, Vance told his people to “keep the cat memes flowing,” even though—or perhaps because—the rumors were putting people in his own state in danger.

Trump repeated the lie at the presidential debate that night, claiming, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Today, President Joe Biden demanded Trump stop his attacks on Haitian-Americans, but Trump doubled down, promising to deport the Haitian immigrants in Springfield if he is elected, although they are here legally. 

The widespread ridicule of Trump’s statement has obscured that this attack on Ohio’s immigrants is part of an attempt to regain control of the Senate. Convincing Ohio voters that the immigrants in their midst are subhuman could help Republicans defeat popular Democratic incumbent senator Sherrod Brown, who has held his seat since 2007. Brown and Montana’s Jon Tester, both Democrats in states that supported Trump in 2020, are key to controlling the Senate. 

Two Republican super PACs, one of which is linked to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have booked more than $82 million of ad space in Ohio between Labor Day and the election and are focusing on immigration. 

Taking control of the Senate would enable Republicans not only to block all popular Democratic legislation, as they did with gun reform after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, but to continue to establish control of America’s judicial system. So long as their judges are in place to make law from the bench, what the majority of Americans want doesn’t matter.

In 1986, when it was clear that most Americans did not support the policies put in place by the Reagan Republicans, the Reagan appointees at the Justice Department broke tradition to ensure that candidates for judgeships shared their partisanship. Their goal, said the president’s attorney general, Ed Meese, was to “institutionalize the Reagan revolution so it can’t be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections.” 

That principle held going forward. Federal judgeships depend on Senate confirmation, and when McConnell became Senate minority leader in 2007, he worked to make sure Democrats could not put their own appointees onto the bench. He held up so many of President Barack Obama’s nominees for federal judgeships that in 2013 Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) prohibited filibusters on certain judicial nominees.

McConnell also made it clear that he would do everything he could to make sure that Democrats could not pass laws, weaponizing the filibuster so that nothing could become law without 60 votes in the Senate.

McConnell became Senate majority leader in 2015 when voters gave Republicans control of the Senate, and when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell refused even to hold hearings for President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. McConnell’s justification for this unprecedented obstruction was that Obama’s March nomination was too close to an election, but the underlying reason for the 2016 delay was at least in part his recognition that hopes of pushing the Supreme Court to the right, especially on the issue of abortion, were likely to get evangelical voters to the polls.

Trump won in 2016, and Republicans got control of the Senate. In 2017, when Democrats tried to filibuster Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia’s long-empty seat, then–majority leader McConnell killed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The end of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees meant that McConnell could push through Trump’s nominees Brett Kavanaugh, with just 50 votes, and Amy Coney Barrett, with just 52 (in late October 2020, with voting for the next president already underway). 

Throughout his tenure as Senate majority leader, McConnell made judicial confirmations a top priority, churning through nominations even when the coronavirus pandemic shut everything else down. Right-wing plaintiffs are now seeking out those judges, like Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, to decide in their favor. Kacsmaryk challenged the FDA’s approval of the drug mifepristone, which can be used in abortions, thus threatening to ban it nationwide.

Meanwhile, at the Supreme Court, Trump appointees are joining with right-wing justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito to overturn precedents established long ago, including the right to abortion. 

Controlling the country through the courts was the plan behind stacking the courts with Republican nominees and weaponizing the filibuster to stop Democrats from passing legislation. In March 2024, in *Slate*, legal analyst Mark Joseph Stern noted that McConnell “realized you don’t need to win elections to enact Republican policy. You don’t need to change hearts and minds. You don’t need to push ballot initiatives or win over the views of the people. All you have to do is stack the courts. You only need 51 votes in the Senate to stack the courts with far-right partisan activists…\[a\]nd they will enact Republican policies under the guise of judicial review, policies that could never pass through the democratic process. And those policies will be bulletproof, because they will be called ‘law.’”

When he took office, President Joe Biden went to work putting his own mark on the federal judiciary. Almost two thirds of his appointees are women, and 62% are people of color. He appointed the first Black female justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the Supreme Court. But now, Republicans are hoping to retake the Senate to make sure that those appointments will stop, along with any more legislation. Their right-wing appointees to the courts will take the business of lawmaking out of the hands of American majorities.

Republican leaders are throwing everything they’ve got at the Senate races in Montana and Ohio, where they hope they can pick up the seat they need to take control of the Senate.

Attacks on immigrants in Ohio might move that needle. 

In 1890, Republicans faced a similar problem. They had lost the popular vote in 1888, although they installed Republican president Benjamin Harrison in office through the Electoral College, and knew the Democrats would soon far outnumber their own voters. So they set out to guarantee that they could never lose the Senate, which should enable them to kill popular Democratic legislation. 

But they misjudged the electorate, and in the 1890 midterm election, voters gave control of the House to the Democrats by a margin of two to one, and control of the Senate came down to a single seat, that of a senator from South Dakota. In those days, state legislatures chose their state’s senators, and shortly after it became clear that control of the Senate was going to depend on that South Dakota seat, U.S. Army troops went to South Dakota to rally voters by putting down an “Indian uprising” in which no people had died and no property had been damaged. 

Fueled on false stories of “savages” who were attacking white settlers, the inexperienced soldiers were the ones who pulled the triggers to kill more than 250 Lakotas on December 29, but the Wounded Knee Massacre started in Washington, D.C.

AskALiberal,1fgnem3,What's behind the recent uptick targeting South Asian Immigrants as of late? ,"What's behind the recent uptick targeting South Asian Immigrants as of late?

Yeah yeah election season and all.

But like... has anyone else noticed this? I mean there's been a general uptick in bigotry since Trump and all, but i wanted to focus specifically on south Asian communities. 

I keep seeing videos of like random white people (often in Canada for some reason, but not always) harassing desi folks.

And it's not restricted to Muslims, there's been a general uptick in hate towards Muslims recently due to certain events (see megathread), but I've seen it directed at hindus, Sikhs (who are often mistaken for Muslim cause turban), and Christians.

I suspect part of it is cause of Kamala's heritage (see one of the most racist tweets I've ever seen brought to you by Laura Loomer), but i don't think that's the whole picture because I've been noticing this since before her candidacy.

Hell, it's so causal that you'll see like ""what race wouldn't you date"" tik toks and they all say some variation on ""indian"".

So like.... wtf. Why are south Asians in particular being targeted with this shit? Anyone got any clue?

Like, we tend to see bigotry increase after certain events. Like 9/11 caused a spike in Islamophohia and hate crimes against Muslims and Sikhs (again turban + racist idiot). Or covid caused a spike in hate crimes towards people of East Asian descent. Was there some event that triggered this recent spike?

AskALiberal,1fgn1o0,Do you think Kamala's ABC interview on Friday was informative or helpful for her campaign?,"I truly went into watching it with an open mind. I really just wanted to see if she would be able to actually expand on her plans she mentioned in the debate. The very first question about her ""opportunity economy"" was met with almost the exact same response she gave to the first question in the debate about her growing up in a middle class family. I understand having at least some type of ""script"" is important to stay on message and continue hammering down her points, but to me she just continues to come off as inauthentic, and doesnt even really know what an ""opportunity economy"" means or how it would help the current economic problems. Her main strategy is these ""feel good"" responses to play on voters emotions and nostalgia. ""Remember when the middle class was thriving and people cared about what their lawns looked like?"" 

She again mentioned a $50,000 tax deduction for start up businesses and $25,000 down payment assistance for first time home buyers. It sounds nice on paper, but I don't see how either of these plans are going to be beneficial or even get close to root of the problems, especially for the housing situation. Why not address corporations or foreign interest being able to buy up properties and force millions of Americans to be renters? What does it even mean and who would it benefit at the end of the day when she says she wants the government to ""partner"" with the private sector to build 3 million new homes? 

She mentions wanting an ""assault weapons ban"" with no explanation of how that would be implemented or even be possible. Again, it sounds good on paper, but it doesnt address the root of the problem and frankly would never make it through both the house and senate. 

I think a major downfall of her campaign has been to completely avoid any kind of response or accountability addressing the current state of the economy and foreign conflicts, and how she would make any of these situations better. She's obviously trying to totally separate herself from Biden, but it comes across as condescending when she is the sitting VP in his administration and can't even explain what she thinks they've done well and want to expand on, or what was mishandled and should be done better.",likeabuddha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1fgn1o0/do_you_think_kamalas_abc_interview_on_friday_was/,/r/AskALiberal/comments/1fgn1o0/do_you_think_kamalas_abc_interview_on_friday_was/,71,2024-09-14 14:15:39,0,,False,0.29,None,2024-09-14 12:19:02.986844

Discussion,1fgpjpk,Conservative politics and unreality.,"The Republican president and vice presidential candidates have, in the past week and a half, begun spreading a racist lie about Haitian immigrants in Ohio. The lie originated with literal white Supremacists (https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-neo-nazis-pushed-false-claims-haitians-part-hate-campaign-rcna170796) and has been proven, over and over again, to be false. 

JD Vance, the weird little Heritage Foundation pick for VP, actually acknowledged on Twitter that the story of immigrants eating pets was a lie, but still encouraged ""patriots"" to spread it. Trump, also, tends to believe whatever he thinks he saw On TV (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/trump-tv-haitians-immigrants-eating-cats/679788/). 

Hannah Arendt was a historian and philosopher who studied totalitarianism and coined the phrase ""The banality of evil"", which was her description of how high-ranking members of the Nazi party were incapable of speaking in anything except Nazi-party approved thought-terminating cliches. Michael Parenti was a historian and political scientist who, in ""Blackshirts and Reds"", wrote that Fascism relies on making otherwise rational people believe and repeat irrational statements - by accepting an irrational, untrue statement as true, conservative politicians create a bloc of people who will willingly accept further untrue statements as factual.

Consider, also, JD Vance's statement(s) that immigrants are responsible for spreading disease and how that, historically, has been used by authoritarians. 

Would the lies being pushed by the incredibly weird Republican candidates meet the criteria of a thought-terminating cliché?

While some of the UN goals have been noble, their incompetence in handling some rather key aspects lead to a lot of the problems we have in the story now.  After reading this latest chapter, here are some of my thoughts:

1. Why did the UN put a mayor from a small town in charge of one of the Ark ships?  >!In the most recent chapter, Hathaway revealed himself to be a massive bootlicker and petty tyrant by essentially trying to become king of a UN colony on Tellus.!< There were only a few of them sent out and, for they knew, this could've been one of the last vestiges of humanity.  Even if they didn't want to send out only top ranking government officials, a few would've been helpful.  I think that a few vice presidents, foreign affairs specialists, or some others may have helped avoid this mess.  They would've been much more suited to handling negotiations with the Krev and keeping their populous happy, rather than what we got with Hathaway.  This shows how the UN wasn't thinking ahead.

2. The whole fiasco around Aafa a few chapters ago.  This one directly resulted in the deaths of countless sapients and could've easily been avoided.  With the SC essentially becomming a larger UN, the cracks in how the ideals worked became apparent quickly.  You had soo many former fed species who essentially wanted a ""Federation 2.0"" that they deadlocked most of what actually led to reforms.  This culminated in the SC abandoning Aafa and inviting two groups who would fight each other rather than actually help.  Had the U.N not allowed these groups to stall everything, Aafa would still stand. 

3. The let malicious actors stay on within their own governance, leading to lack of trust and forming genuine allies.  In this, I am calling out General Jones as being a huge impediment towards proper peace.  Her schemes/threats actively undermined the SC promises and likely caused many of our nominal allies to remain nominal, instead of true ones.  In particular, her handling of Tassi was artocious and made their transition into the SC even worse, pushing the Bissems towards the Yotul and Arxur.

DeltaFoxtrot,1fgpefq,From Russia With Love,"In a discussion with RAND experts John F. Tefft and William Courtney, several key issues related to U.S. policy towards Russia were explored, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, cybersecurity threats, economic sanctions, and the future of arms control. Both experts highlighted the complexities that the next U.S. president will face in navigating Russia's aggression and its global implications. Tefft, a former U.S. ambassador to several countries including Russia and Ukraine, and Courtney, who has a background in arms control and U.S.-Russia relations, offer their perspectives on how the U.S. can address these challenges.

One of the primary foreign policy challenges identified by Tefft is the need to resist Russia's aggression in Ukraine and continue supporting Ukraine's military and economic efforts. Both experts agree that U.S. efforts must be sustained to prevent Russia from succeeding in its war of attrition. In addition to the immediate threat posed by Russia, Tefft emphasized the importance of maintaining NATO's unity and addressing long-term challenges like nuclear arms control, emerging technologies, and potential political changes in Russia.

Courtney pointed out that the U.S. must also confront Russia while finding ways to cooperate in areas of mutual interest, such as climate change and the International Space Station. The U.S. faces the challenge of balancing military support for Ukraine with broader geopolitical concerns, including bolstering NATO forces and maintaining a stable nuclear arms balance as the New START Treaty nears expiration.

Regarding the war in Ukraine, both experts believe that continued U.S. support is essential. Tefft suggests that the U.S. should exhibit strategic patience, similar to its approach during the Cold War, while Courtney advocates for raising the costs of Russia's aggression, drawing parallels to the U.S. strategy during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

In the realm of cybersecurity, Tefft and Courtney underscore the growing threat posed by Russian cyberattacks. They emphasize the need for the U.S. to bolster defenses and increase collaboration between the public and private sectors. Sanctions and accountability measures for bad actors will be key to addressing these threats.

When it comes to Russian interference in U.S. elections, both experts argue for a strong response. Tefft suggests implementing new sanctions, while Courtney points to the need for both overt and covert measures to deter future interference, drawing on lessons from the 2016 election.

The economic sanctions imposed on Russia have had a significant impact, though Tefft acknowledges that Russia has been able to evade some of them. Both experts agree that sanctions are a long-term tool and that continued refinement is needed to tighten the screws on Russia's war economy. Courtney highlights the growing economic pressures within Russia, such as capital flight and inflation, which are signs of a deteriorating economy.

The future of arms control is uncertain, with both experts expressing doubts about the renewal of the New START Treaty. Tefft and Courtney see little hope for new agreements while Russia wages war in Ukraine, and both suggest that any new treaty would likely need to include China, given its growing nuclear capabilities.

Lastly, the experts agree that change will eventually come to Russia, possibly driven by internal pressures from economic, demographic, and political factors. Tefft and Courtney suggest that the U.S. must be prepared for potential shifts in Russian leadership, similar to the liberalizing changes seen under Mikhail Gorbachev. Such changes could open the door for new arms control agreements and a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.",boutoille,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaFoxtrot/comments/1fgpefq/from_russia_with_love/,/r/DeltaFoxtrot/comments/1fgpefq/from_russia_with_love/,0,2024-09-14 16:01:15,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

""That was when we were united under the fundamental principles that Merriam laid out. But when they dared to abolish the Arrows, they broke the rules of the game. This is it. I will not give them a moment of rest. The Grant years were devastating for America. The Findlay Massacre and the Twilight Purge... I owe it to this country to prevent something like that from ever happening again.""

""Well, after the conference in Nashville, I'm sure the other parties in the opposition think like you. The Atlantic Union, the Solidarists, Popular Front, even Prohibition—all of them. They smell blood in the water.""

""Good. Because we're going to need them. It's not just about fighting in Congress, but out on the streets. The Blueshirts and their militias won’t back down easily, but neither will we. Our paramilitary wings are getting stronger by the day. I also appealed to friends in the armed forces and the police to support us, make sure the other parties do the same. I was one of the main supporters of passing the bill for universal military training, there are enough supporters of the constitution and those who remembered what we fought for during the War across the American population, no matter what Stelle thinks. We're ready to take them on, step by step.""

""And you're willing to align with groups that just a year ago, you would never have stood beside?""

""Desperate times. Besides, we've made compromises before. The Popular Front may have their own agenda, but their hatred of Stelle runs as deep as ours. If we can work together to drive this administration into the ground, then we will. But make no mistake, it won't be pretty.""

""How far are you willing to go?""

""As far as it takes. They want to play dirty—well, we know how to fight too. We’ll shut down every bill they try to pass, tie them up in committee, filibuster their agenda into oblivion. I have already started investigations regarding impeachment. And on the streets? We’re going to organize like they’ve never seen. The time for niceties is over. This is war, plain and simple. I'll let you on a little secret, many of Stelle's most ardent supports in the party got purged in an internal scandal.""

""I have to admit, I didn’t expect you to turn into the face of this. But after the midterms, you’re becoming more of a figurehead for the opposition than I expected.""

""Someone had to step up. Stelle and his cronies are dragging the country into the dirt, and no one else was willing to call it what it is; treason against the Republic. I swear to God I won’t rest until we’ve taken them down. This is about the future of America, and I’ll be damned if we let another dictator rise.""

""Do you think this is really going to resonate with the public? Most of them are tired of the chaos, the street clashes, the paramilitaries. They want peace, stability, not another civil conflict.""

""That's exactly why we need to be the ones to offer a clear, uncompromising vision for the future. We need to remind them of what’s at stake: the values of 1912, the Constitution, the rule of law. We aren't just fighting to remove a corrupt administration, we're fighting for the soul of this country. And if it means allying with the Popular Front, the Solidarists or even these prohibition boys, to stop Stelle and his Legion from dragging us into the abyss, then so be it. The stakes are too high to play it safe now.""

""And you think the coalition will hold?""

""It has to. We’re in this together now. If we falter, Stelle and his regime will consolidate their power. The next few months will be crucial. We fight. With everything we’ve got.""",Artistic_Victory,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fgpbu5/guardians_of_the_republic_a_house_divided/,/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fgpbu5/guardians_of_the_republic_a_house_divided/,1,2024-09-14 15:58:27,4,,False,1.0,Alternate Election Lore,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

kpopthoughts,1fgp9xw,Jungkook's unwavering love and support for his juniors is heartwarming,"One of the very first thing Jungkook said when Hybe was created was that he looked forward to having juniors  since BTS themselves never had seniors to look after them (and he probably kind of tired of always being the youngest). He was so excited to have his first [juniors to be proud of with txt](https://x.com/0X1_1304/status/1783563591653945680), constantly [mentioning them in unrelated interviews,](https://youtu.be/yRl4Q-0Oaik?t=82) celebrating [birthdays](https://x.com/PopBase/status/1701888138098946422), shooting [tiktoks](https://x.com/syoogas/status/1713178514156118119) with them and leaving them small [notes](https://x.com/koosjunie/status/1753953624516890913) and even [thoughtful gifts](https://x.com/BTStranslation_/status/1410211902211248131). Their bond is especially heartwarming since Jungkook is not that much older than them, he's only two years older than Yeonjun but you can tell he was glad to be able to act as the doting sunbae for once.

Then came Enhypen, and that one is actually quite funny because the whole reason why his private tiktok account was leaked is because he [shared their seven challenge.](https://x.com/ningikeu/status/1776311048527921405) Iconic user Letjungcook7 would never have seen the light if not for his desire to support and brag about his new juniors. Enhypen also happens to have some of the [loudest JK stans](https://x.com/JJK_Times/status/1346320551095066624) and I'm just so happy that they get to interact positively with their idol who is just as [loudly supportive of them](https://x.com/JJK_Times/status/1341229201978880005). In the biggest Jungkook fanboy competition, Boy Next Door is also quite hight up the ladder and Jungkook seems to[ find them adorable](https://x.com/jianextdoor/status/1684247979983777794). He publically thanked both TXT Taehyun and Boy Next Door Jaehyun for their Seven covers. He keeps their signed album on his[ lil album shelf ](https://x.com/trinhers/status/1687536786384289792)and you can tell how [thankfull they are for their supportive seniors](https://x.com/homeisjungkook/status/1686380477836615680).

While Seventeen only became part of Hybe recently and can't exactly be considered a junior, I think it's fair to say that it's one of the groups Jungkook has shown a lot of public support for, and it's not for nothing that he's called the armycarat president. He has several close friends in SVT and imo deserves his spot as the secret [14th seventeen member.](https://x.com/dailyjmthv/status/1709635696934130121) Not only has he been to their [concerts](https://x.com/minghaoareyou_/status/1775007259208327231) before, he also enjoy [singing](https://x.com/WwangelbabywW/status/1620844908629344256) and [dancing their whole playlist](https://x.com/kopinyoup/status/1733144342909325385/video/1) (worth noting that their two fandoms were in the middle of dumb fanwars). He’s obviously [bestie with Mingyu,](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1676329007715954688) but I find his [friendship with Seungkwan](https://x.com/jiminterludez/status/1798226862117998720) to be also quite unexpected and wholesome.

As far as showing support for his labelmates goes, I think his support for Lesserafim is also noteworthy. He's a pretty big gg stans but he seems to restrict himself more when it comes to showing public support to them, mostly because he's big target for shippers and rumors. However, he's been a vocal fan of their music since their debut, [dancing to their debut song ](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1555874756074905600)and even [singing to their music ](https://x.com/JeonJungkook_BR/status/1635646474296934400)in his lives several time. Of course, the [iconic perfect night tiktok challenge](https://x.com/sserapics/status/1825958004480684042) went pretty viral on the k-side of things but the [SNTY challenge ](https://x.com/JTKblueberry/status/1794448283198222768)they filmed in response is less known yet just as impressive imo. He also interacted with their fan content on tiktok, notably by posting laughing emojis to Chaewon's famous dokdok meme but some antis tried to twist the narrative and used this interaction to call him a predator(??)... (Chaewon is only 3 years younger btw)

As for Newjeans, he’s been a vocal Ditto lover since the song came out, but to be fair he's sang probably half their discography on his lives so it's hard to list all the instances (I remember Super shy, OMG, Hype Boy, tbh I first discovered most of their songs through him lol). He also loves Ditto's [choreo](https://x.com/jeonjkloops/status/1685291435224903680) and ended up filming a [challenge](https://x.com/newtannies/status/1713470675782877445) with the girls loooong after Ditto era was over. He has a signed NJ album on his album shelf as welln and was promoting their songs on his lives more than his own solo work even when they were in direct competition for SOTY.

He follows and supports Hybe artists on his socials despite not being active. He started following ILLIT on Tiktok despite the fact that their debut comeback happened months after he enlisted (and even though he's been pretty much MIA since then). He even covers labelmates from different countries like when he covered [Imase's japanese song, ](https://x.com/jjklve/status/1661870975078596609)and took a picture with him, and with many artists that I can't remember right now.

He's shown a lot of appreciation for artists outside of his company as well, even with artists whose fandoms have  beef with his own fans. I've seen him sing and dance to Exo, Blackpink, and pretty much every YG artists under the sun when the fanwars were at its strongest. There are so many fancams out there of him being supportive during performances or award show speeches that I have more difficulty finding groups he hasn't shown public support for in the past than the opposite (seriously it's like guy knows all the songs bar for bar sometimes...)

He's THE quintessential kpop stan in a way because he listens to everything, girl groups, boy groups, juniors, seniors, even jpop which is why he wrote a couple of their japanese songs. He himself joined BH when he was only 13 yo because he was a huge IU fan and he wanted to shine in a similar way. He already has a 11 year-old careed in the industry and that's because he debuted as a 15 yo with big dreams and a genuine love for his job.

(Needless to say, this post was sort of inspired by the recent instagram post JK made on Bam's account stating that ""artists are not guilty"" but it is NOT meant to address any of that controversy and I would kindly ask you not to comment on this specific topic. This is an appreciation thread for all the support Jungkook has shown over the years for his junior as well as other artists because, to me, it's one of his most endearing trait. I believe that he's a very straightforward person so when he says that he supports ""artists"", he means that and nothing more, he will always take the side of his fellow artists over any company executives).",Few_Performance_6497,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1fgp9xw/jungkooks_unwavering_love_and_support_for_his/,/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1fgp9xw/jungkooks_unwavering_love_and_support_for_his/,4,2024-09-14 15:56:05,8,,False,0.63,Appreciation,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

IsTheMicStillOn,1fgp249,Report: U.S. hostages still owe taxes. Congress might not help.,"Source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/14/congress-irs-penalties-us-hostages/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/14/congress-irs-penalties-us-hostages/)

**First few paragraphs:**

Members of Congress agree they must change the law so that Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained by terrorist groups or foreign governments don’t owe penalties for failing to pay taxes while they’re captive. But their attempt to address that problem is stuck in a fight over other legislation.

The Senate in May unanimously passed a measure that would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from assessing penalties to freed hostages who didn’t file or pay taxes during their ordeal. On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee unanimously advanced similar legislation

But the House committee packaged the hostage tax bill with a measure that would make it easier for the government to strip tax-exempt status from nonprofit groups over allegations of support for terrorism.

And because of an arcane procedural step Congress took to try to speed passage of the hostage bill, that move probably prevented it from becoming law.

The Senate used an obscure tool called a “deeming resolution” to approve the hostage provision — it unanimously declared that once the legislation passes the House, it would also be considered passed by the Senate. But if the bill is altered in any way in the House, the Senate’s action is moot.

The House bill, though, is different from the Senate’s because of the section on nonprofits. Free speech and pro-Palestinian advocacy groups oppose that provision, concerned that it could be leveraged to silence organizations with dissenting views or halt the work of humanitarian agencies that operate in areas controlled by terrorist entities, especially in the context of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. That opposition probably dooms the House bill’s chances in the Senate.

“Ways and Means, by adding an unrelated bill to it, guarantees that \[the deeming resolution\] won’t work and that we will either have to revise it, change it, send it back, or that we won’t get this done in this Congress,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), one of the hostage bill’s main supporters, told The Washington Post. “My hope is that the House will recognize they have a chance to just send this bill to us and it goes directly to the president’s desk.”

**My Thought:**

Imagine being a hostage for a decade and coming back to Uncle Sam saying ""Hey bro by the way you owe me $20,000.""",GoodGoodNotTooBad,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsTheMicStillOn/comments/1fgp249/report_us_hostages_still_owe_taxes_congress_might/,/r/IsTheMicStillOn/comments/1fgp249/report_us_hostages_still_owe_taxes_congress_might/,0,2024-09-14 15:46:22,1,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

This doesn’t even have much to do with her I guess as much as it has to do with her fans. She is certainly allowed to feel heart break and express that, but I think there is a level of awareness that maybe she’s lacking/truly doesn’t care about because there’s no way she didn’t know that her fans were going to go be weird about this on Oliver’s page and start harassing him. 

If this is how she behaves every time a relationship doesn’t work out, it’ll be very difficult for her to be in a long term, healthy relationship because god forbid it doesn’t workout, and then other person is just put on blast regardless of what actually went on behind the scenes.

exmormon,1fgotk5,When TSCC gets asked the temple recommend questions...,"|Question|TSCC Response|
|:-|:-|
|**1:** Do you have faith in and a testimony of God the Eternal Father; His Son Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?|Yes, but I used to think they were the trinity and now I think they're 3 separate people.|
|**2:** Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Christ and of His role as your Savior and Redeemer?|Yes, but you don't need Him if you follow the ""covenant path""^(TM) and attend the Temple ~~regularly~~ weekly.|
|**3:** Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?|Don't you mean the *CONTINUING* restoration??|
|**4a:** Do you sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?|Yes, but only the current one. I don't follow *DEAD* prophets. Dead prophets have a habit of ""speaking as a man"".|
|**4b:** Do you sustain members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?|Yes, but I have strong opinions about who should die next.|
|**4c:** Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the Church?|Does this include the female authorities? I don't think it should include the female authorities...and female authorities are still unpaid, right?|
|**5a:** The Lord has said that all things are to be “done in cleanliness” before Him (Doctrine and Covenants 42:41). Do you strive for moral cleanliness in your thoughts and behavior?|That depends on what your definition of moral is? And now that I think about it...also your definition of cleanliness? Either way, I've received the 2nd Anointing, so it doesn't matter.|
|**5b:** Do you obey the law of chastity?|If I'm sealed to the teenagers that I have sex with, that are not my only wife, that my wife doesn't know I'm sealed to, that sometimes clean my house, that sometimes watch my children, that are usually 20-40 years younger than I am, is that chaste? Then, YES. I live the law of chastity!|
|**6:** Do you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private and public behavior with members of your family and others?|I just told you I do! I lie to my wife and get with as many teenage girls as possible! And publicly, I deny ALL OF IT.|
|**7:** Do you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine contrary to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?|Doctrines of which decade and what prophet? You'll need to be more specific.|
|**8:** Do you strive to keep the keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at church; attend your meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament; and live your life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?|What's the difference between laws and commandments again? Is that like when Hinkley said polygamy is a practice, not a principle?|
|**9:** Do you strive to be honest in all that you do?|Yes. I even lie for the Lord!|
|**10:** Are you a full-tithe payer?|We don't pay tithing. We exempted ourselves from paying tithing decades ago, if not centuries.|
|**11:** Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?|Do I understand it? Yes. Do I obey it? Heck no! I mean, not until US prohibition anyway. ...does iced tea count? What about certain drugs? Is there some sort of list you can show me?|

KamalaHarris,1fgor9w,Harris campaign launches $3M effort on Spanish-language radio,"The Harris campaign plans to roll out a $3 million dollar Spanish-language radio effort and organizing push aimed at Latino voters in battleground states as Hispanic Heritage Month kicks off.

The radio push includes an investment into Spanish-language radio stations, supporting existing pushes on bilingual television. According to the release, 96% of Latinos listen to the radio weekly.

This effort will also include a bilingual phone banking program, the strengthening of a messenger program that seeks to educate Latino communities about the election and digital content from Latino activists and organizers about reproductive freedom.

Vice President Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), are planning to attend events, such as baseball games, boxing matches and Mexican Independence Day festivities, in key states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as part of the push.

Harris also plans to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual conference on Sept. 18. Her agenda focuses on building up middle-class Latino families, the press release said.

“Latinos con Harris-Walz” will hold events alongside Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) in Michigan. Garcia plans to travel to Minnesota on Sunday in celebration of Mexican Independence Day.

chaosmagick,1fgoipb,🃏 14 Temperance: The Fool's/Hero's Journey thru the Major Arcana,"This is 1/22 Posts re: Examining the Major Arcana of the Tarot via the Psychological Model, specifically Jungian Psychology. I am doing Daily Meditations on each corresponding chapter of Sallie Nichols' amazingly InSightFul Masterpiece, [""Jung and Tarot: An Archetypal Journey"" (1980 Weiser)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chaosmagick/comments/1f52voy/00_tarot_the_foolsheros_journey_thru_the_major/) for over 3 Weeks straight in this month of Sept 2024. As someone who majored in Psych & trained in NLP before working in MH/Mental Health for over a decade+, I think Sharing my Reflections may prove of Use to some out there. Giving a PsychoLogical Model breakdown of the Archetypes of the Major Tarot should be inValuable in itself, & I truly hope you find it of as much Use as I am & have, as well!

.

***14 Temperance***

""Temperance: Heavenly Alchemist""

**Exemplified by:** Moderation, Blending of Compliments/Opposites, SynThesis and other syn- words, Mediator, Alchemy, Tempering (e.g., Steel),

Unlike the 13 Death Card, this Card has Angel Wings in the Flesh tone, as if our Half-Zombie Half-Skeleton has been lifted up & turned into Wings to Carry us aLoft.  The Ground is now Golden w/ Healthy Green Sprouts.

Most notably and obviously, however, is the Harmony & Balance that the Reds & Blues seem to be Visually displaying.  Note that the Cup of Heavenly Blue is pouring into the Cup of Blood Red, the Colour of the Manifestation of Life.

Whilst I know that we aren't focusing much on the AstroloLogical Symbols of the Major Arcana, I must point out that the Sign usually Associated w/ Temperance is Sagittarius, but I cannot think of a more intemperate Sign LOL  It always seemed like Sag should go to 7 The Chariot to me, but I digress...

Synchronistically enough, Sallie begins this chapter mentioning how this Card is Connected to Aquarius, the Water-Bearer (note that Dali also attributes Aquarius to 14 Temperance as shown below).  This makes me wonder if there are other alternative Attributional Systems that rather than assigning Symbols in the Systematic Ways they've been aScribed to the Tree of Life & Tarot - specifically one that actually takes the 2 Connecting Sephiroth into account when assigning Symbols like Astrological Signs & Major Arcana Tarot Card to it, regardless of NumeroLogical, Sequential, &/or other Orderings.  Comment below if you know of any alt-Systems like I describe here, below PLZ!

*""Aquarius Rules the Circulation of the Blood and has been corRelated w/ the Circulation of Ideas (Air Sign).  It Traditionally Symbolized the disSolution of Old Forms and the Loosening of Rigid Bonds, heralding a Liberation from the World of Phenonomena.""* (p249)

Sallie astutely points out that the Liquid betwixt the Red & Blue containers is a White, Pure Essence.

MindFull of the Map of our Journey - and the many Mirrored Cards like the 2 Popes or the 2 Emperors - I'm reMinded that here we have our Angel right before 15 The Devil (The Fallen Angel) comes in next.  I almost wonder if 14-16 are a mini-Drama by themselves, from Angel, to Fallen Angel, to perhaps our Fallen Angel Crashes into 16 The Tower, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  Getting back to re: Angels, Sallie states:

*""Angels have long been seen as Winged Messengers from Heaven, Meaning psychologically that they Represent Inner Experiences of a Numinous nature which Connect Man w/ the Archetypal world of the unConscious.  These Winged Visions appear in our Mundane Lives at crucial moments, suddenly bringing New InSights and revealing New Dimensions of Experience...""*

*""Her Wings tell us she is SuperHuman - able to rise above Petty, Mundane Matters.""* (p250)

*""For Meister Eckhart, Angels Represented 'Ideas of God.'  According to Jung, an Angel personifies the coming into Consciousness of something New arising from the Deep unConscious.  He once deFined Angels more specifically as 'personified transmitters of unConscious Contents which announce that they want to Speak.'  The Angel Temperance, as we see, has not yet made a pronouncement.  But if the Hero wishes to Hear the Angel's Message, he could probably initiate a Dialogue w/ her.  Such a Dialogue establishes a living Relationship to the Answering 'Other' within."" (p251)*

*""This Method of Dramatizing one's Connection w/ an Inner Figure (which Jung calls ""Active Imagination"") was apparently used by the Alchemists, too.  They called it MEDITATIO.  Ruland the Lexicographer defines Meditatio as ""an Inner Dialogue w/ someone who is Invisible, as also w/ God, or w/ oneself, or w/ one's Good Angel""* (p251), forgetting our Bad Angel.  This is important to note as Jung always believed Angels - like all Archetypes - to be of dubious Morality.  Sallie points out we can Trust this Angel as she has a 5-petaled Flower on her Head, the Symbol of QuintEssence & Spirit correctly placed, as this is the Symbol of the Twice-Born, or ""Born-Again"" as many a Pentecostal Christian refers to it.

Sallie then goes on at length about how the Leminiscate Hats of our 1 Magician & 11 Force have now become the 2 Vases, but I see the Leminiscate giving our Hero Wings, turning INTO the Angel in this Card.

*""In 7 The Chariot* (the End of the 1st Row as this is the End of the 2nd Row, just below 7 The Chariot & above 21 The Universe) *the task of the Libido was to Move our Hero FWD on his Journey.  In 14 Temperance the Libido itself undergoes TransFormation.  The Opposites, which were pictured at the Beginning of the Realm of Equilibrium as the 2 Pans of 8 Justice's Scales held apart by a fixed bar, are now shown as Red & Blue Containers for the 1 Unique Fluid of Being.  They  have now become alternate Forms which Shape & Hold this elan vital.""* (p 254)

*""When these 2 Worlds get mixed up unConsciously, w/ no Guardian Angel to preside, our Lives become Muddled & Cornfused, often w/ Disastrous Results.  If we try to live on the Outer Side a Drama that more properly belongs to the Inner, the plot could End in Tragedy.  We might, for example, Project the Angel Temperance onto some person of our acquaintance, handing over to this person's care and keeping all our Conflicts, Problems, Hopes, and Dreams, expecting this seemingly Superior Being to Guard and Regulate the Flow of our Life.  If so, it goes w/o saying that the Angel of Card 14 would 1 day pop up in our Deck as the Devil of Card 15.""*

*""It is equally imPractical, of course, to attempt to squeeze into our Inner World events which properly belong in Outer Reality.  If, for example, we have a Problem w/ our Spouse or Neighbor, it is futile to take this Drama wholly on the Symbolic Level, spending long hours concocting Imaginary Dialogues w/ this Person or Theorizing in Solitary Confinement about possible Reasons for the Other's Behaviour.  Although some Introspection is valuable, there comes a time when one must step into Reality and initiate a Real-Life Dialogue w/ the Person in question.  Quite often, when we summon the Courage to do this, we find the Outer Reality to be much less Threatening than the Inner Drama we had concocted.  It can even happen that what appeared in our Imagination as a Tragedy of Antagonism turns out in fact to be a Comedy of Errors.""* (p255)

Sally then ends this short chapter writing about the middle 7 Major Arcana that comprise the Realm of Equilibrium, beginning w/ more comparisons betwixt this Card's Fluid, Gentle demeanor cf. 8 Justice's Rigid, Harsh demeanor, reminding us that Justice needs to be Tempered w/ Mercy.

She points out how the Middle Row of the Major Arcana deal mostly w/ Moral Problems.  They also act as a Row as a Mediating Force betwixt the Top & Bottom Rows.  Note that in the Top Row we have either Male or Female Energies, but in this Row we have a coMingling of these Complimentary Opposites: e.g., the Lady Justice is holding a Sword (Masculine), our Hermit is wearing flowing Robes (Feminine), we have literal Balancing in 10 & 14, w/ the Lady Magician & Lion in 11, & the Man being subMerged into Mother Earth in 12.  13 is of course Universal irrespective of Gender, for Death comes for us All.

Sallie also astutely points out that most of the Figures in this Row are Feminine, either as Female or as a non-Threatening Old Man or the emasculated Hanged Man.  She concludes this chapter w/ some Alchemy:

*""In Alchemical Language, the 'Gluten of the Eagle' and the 'Blood of the Lion' were mingled in the 'Philosophical Egg', or 'Alembic', then subjected to Heat.  In 14 Temperance we see pictured the Beginning Phase of this Great Work, the Angel's Compassionate concern furnishing the Heat necessary to Start the 'Cooking' Process.  The next 2 Cards (15 The Devil & 16 The Tower of Destruction) will show Ways in which various other kinds of Heat - speaking both Alchemically & Psychologically - will be applied.""* (p258)

JimCornette,1fgohm9,"Book report guy, this time I have Chris Jericho's first book from 2008. Tons of interesting stories, including his unflattering opinion on Jim Cornette from his time Smokey Mountain.","I just finished Chris Jericho's 1st book from 2008, ""A Lions Tale."" This is one of the best wrestler written books and is filled with interesting stories from various promotions through the 90s.

It's a genuine classic wrestling book here that is super fun to read. It was co-written with Peter Thomas Fornatale, but it's nearly impossible not to hear Jericho's voice as you read this. Very inciteful and very funny. Even if you don't like Jericho, you can't deny how fun and easy this book is to read.

As always, I try to go in chronological order, but I did structure this to keep all his individual company stories together, despite some overlap existing in the timelines. Hope y'all enjoy!

Chris got really into Christian Rock music when he was a teenager and even started going to church every Sunday. He became a legit Sunday school teacher at 16 years old. 

Chris's first idea for a wrestling character was a Christian babyface called ""Christian Chris Irvine"" who would preach Bible verses and such.

Chris remembers being slightly disappointed by the state of the ""Hart Brothers Wrestling School"" out of Calgary in 1988. This was Stampede's last gasp of life after it shut down in 1984 and reopened a couple of years later when Bruce insisted on it. Keith Hart (one of the more levels headed and realistic of the Hart Clan) ran Jericho through some bumps and said he was impressed. 

Chris ran into Bret Hart at Golds Gym in Winnipeg and told him he was going to the Hart Wrestling School, and Bret was surprised to hear it was still open. At this point, Bret was 5 years removed from Stampede, so of course, he wouldn't know it's still operating.

When Chris left for Calgary, he remembers driving away and looking in the rear view mirror to see his mom wave him off before she walked back inside. Chris notes how this is the last time he ever saw his mom walk. Pretty heartbreaking tbh

Chris met Lance Storm on the 1st day of wrestling school, and the two gravitated towards each other because no one else in the camp was taking it seriously or even been to a gym before. According to Chris, both guys maintain as of writing that if the other one wasn't there, they both would have quit early on.

The only Hart brother they saw at the Hart training school, was a 30 minute 1-time appearance by Keith who just showed up to collect the money and have everyone sign a ridiculous contract that said they would owe 10% of all earnings to the Hart's. Chris interrupted a speech and asked Keith how many matches he had. When Keith said he didn't know, Chris decided right then and there that he would keep a record of all his matches. And he still does, to this day.

Chris portrays Keith Hart in a bad light as a bully who just wanted to hurt Chris for asking him how many matches he had. Keith made Chris take a back body drop with no explaining or training, so a panicked Chris over flipped and landed on his feet. Chris says this pissed Keith off, who kneed Chris in the back and applied a grapevine submission until he got bored. I've never heard stories of Keith Hart taking liberties with anyone, not even Bruce suggested it, and he once accused Keith of lacing a joint with other drugs. But wrestlers are usually like that with cocky teenagers, so it's possible.

Chris was primarily trained by Ed Langley, an old Stampede Wrestling referee who claimed to have wrestled as Mr X in the WWF. Chris says Ed had Stu Hart's ""Wrestling manual"" and followed it to a tee. Chris says that in a way, Stu Hart did train him because they followed his ""Wrestling manual."" I have read several Hart related books and have never heard anyone describe a Stu Hart written Wrestling manual. I think Chris just likes to say he was pseudo trained by Stu Hart.

After wrestling for a couple of years, in late 1992, a friend of Chris's named Mike Lazowski was offered to come to Mexico and wrestle if he had a tag partner. So him and Jericho moved to Mexico, where they were paid $700 a week for at least 2 matches, and they get free food from a restaurant the promoter owned.

Jericho accuses this same promoter of wanting Chris to wrestle in a speedo because Chris said the promoter was gay.

Jericho describes real fist fights in the ring with Mexican wrestlers who didn't like foreigners coming in.

Jericho worked his first 10,000 person show and remembers thinking he he could never go back to small Canadian territories.

While Jericho acknowledges that Mil Mascaras was super over, he also calls him ""rotton as hell"" and says he kept his mask on backstage at all times, even while showering. Mick Foley had even less flattering things to say about Mascaras n his book.

Jericho says he became a bit of a celebrity while wrestling in Monterrey and even subbed in for an injured Vampiro in a main event match with Norman (Black Magic) Smiley 

Jericho said Vampiro wasn't sincere when congratulating Chris after the show for the good match, and Chris was later warned again by the promoter how most local guys are super jealous of his spot.
 
Jericho would eventually start getting booked in Mexico City by promoter Paco Alonso,  where Chris paired up with Hector Guerrero, who would watch Chris's back in terms of backstage politics.

Chris says Vampiro gave him his number and told Chris to call if he needed anything. Though Chris called the number, an old lady picked up who had never heard of Vampiro.

Chris says that the guy who handled payroll once confided to him that Vampiro was always asking how much Chris got paid.

Chris said he quickly became a legit national star, making 3-4 grand a week with no real expenses. He said he was working every day of the week, including 4 matches on Saturdays.

Chris credits Negro Casas as someone he learned a ton from and Chris calls Casas one of the smartest performers he ever met.

Chris describes meeting Eddie Guerrero who was 100% hostile towards Chris and calling him a mark for himself. The next day, a sober Eddie apologized to Chris for ""whatever I said last night.""

Jericho remembers causing commotion at a Mexican airport and having King Haku come back him up until one of the air port security officers pulled a gun on them. A $350 and a few autographs layer and Jericho and Haku were free to go.

Chris says he became close friends with Art Barr in Mexico, and it wad Art who introduced Chris to Rey Mysterio. Chris was confused and thought Art was introducing him to a 10 year old child and was shocked to find Rey was 18 years old  and trying to be a wrestler. Chris remembers thinking, ""awh, bless his little heart.""

Chris started doing the Lionsalt in Mexico as a way to standout since everyone was doing the top rope moonsalt.

Chris describes how devastated he was by Art Barr's sudden death, and how he cleaned up Art's room so the police wouldn't find anything that could shame Art's wife and kids.

Art's death, and the fall of the Mexican peso, pushed Chris towards leaving to Europe. He said with Art dead and business down, the moral backstage at shows nose dived.

After some short time in Germany, Jericho says Lance Storm got him in touch with Jim Cornette who was running Smokey Mountain Wrestling at the time. Cornette brought Jericho and Storm into the company in early 1994 as The Thrillseekers and pushed them right away. 

Chris shits on Cornette's idea of what kind of gear he wanted Chris to wear, with Chris calling it ""Southern Spirit Squad"" and said his name would have been printed out in some gold material on the front of his outfit. Chris even points out and pokes fun of Jim's big belly when he was wearing a Smokey Mountain t-shirt.

After hearing Chris speak so highly of Mexico and Europe, despite the culture shock, its kinda disappointing to hear him just shit all over Knoxville and their culture. He makes fun of the way they talk, specifically saying he didn't know what ""Hey y'all"" meant and says the food was more foreign than anything he had in literal third world countries. I'm from Canada as well, so I have no ties to southern culture, but Jericho certainly seems to think low of them southerners.

Chris is super critical of himself and Lance Cade as The Thrillseekers in SMW, and hates how dumb he looked in the vignets he filmed. I love Jim, but his vision doesn't often translate to the screen for these types of videos so I can see where Chris is coming from. But it's clear Chris was against it from the start and hated everything from where they filmed the vignets to what they wore. He said Jim was called ""Corny"" for a reason.

Chris negotiated $850 per week for him and Lance, each. But Chris hated how they hard they had to work to sell merchandise at shows and is critical of both the promotion and himself. He said selling the merch on intermission hurt their larger than life characters, but with hindsight Chris acknowledges that this is how you made money in that territory and it was part of the deal he made with Jim, so he should have just done it.

Chris is also pretty judgmental on how The Rock n Roll Express made money, as Chris would watch them accept gifts from the fans, only to turn around and sell it to someone else with their autographs now on it. Chris is critical but acknowledges that they made sometimes thousands of dollars per night.

Just like Mick Foley, Chris has nothing but positive things to say on Brian Hildebrand, a friend of Jim's and referee for SMW.

After moving to Tennessee, Jericho remembers Cornette getting mad at him and Lance for not living their gimmicks and sleeping with women all over town. Lance was legit married and Jericho said that he, ""had standards."" Jericho is extremely critical of the lack of social avenues for him to pursue in Tennessee and very critical of the people who lived there. Chris sounded miserable in SMW.

Jim had Chris and Lance debut and cut promos as babyface Canadians in Tennessee, and Chris rightfully points out that no one in that crowd would care about them being Canadian or Chris's dad being a real NHL player. 

Chris is also critical of their debut match, which used the penalty box concept to play off them being Canadian. Chris says the match was good on paper but bad in execution, and that the fans couldn't follow it and they hated it.

Chris puts over the double team finisher him and Lance would do where they both leap from the same turbuckle and hit a double drop kick. He says it was innovative and the fans loved it, but it caught them heat because Rock n Roll Express used a double drop kick finisher as well, but it wasn't from the turnbuckle. Jericho throws a little shade adding ""they delivered there's from the mat, and only connected waist high. If they connected at all.""

Chris says that the Rock n Roll Express ""were furious and buried us to the boss."" He says Gibson and Morton were two-faced about it though, and they were all smiles to Chris and Lance in person, but complained about them non-stop to everyone else.

For as critical as Jericho is here, he does go out if his way to call Ricky Morton, ""one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time and one of top 3 babyface sellers ever.""

Chris talks about the ribs that Rock n roll Express would pull with onr horrifying one in particular sticking out. They would challenge someone backstage to close their eyes and attempt to poke a spot on the wall that was designated. When the person walked toward the wall with their eyes closed and finger out, Robert Gibson would drop his pants and line it up to the guy sticks his finger in Roberts ass. Jericho implies this happened to him by commenting on how warm and moist it was. I really hope he is joking.

Jericho says he was initially pissed when Cornette asked him to drive Dick Murdoch around, but says it was a highlight of his career and puts over how great Murdoch is, specifically saying, ""he wasn't racist. He was honest and fair. He hated everyone equally."" 

I don't know about this, in Jim Ross's first book he recalled one time when Dick Murdoch literally showed off his own genuine KKK member card. JR was confused why Murdoch was showing him and expected it to be a rib of some kind. But Murdoch just walked off and no one jumped out laughing. 

In Billy Graham's book, Billy had nothing nice to say about Dick Murdoch. According to Billy, it wasn't uncommon for Murdoch to be a belligerent, racist and sexist drunk. One time Murdoch called a waitress the n-word, which made Ray Stevens threaten to punch his lights out if he ever said it again. Billy said Murdoch was just an ""absolute racist loser.""

Jericho really puts over these drives with Murdoch as super fun and says Murdoch taught him how to throw a beet bottle at a speed limit sign while driving 80 miles per hour. 

Jericho mentions bunking in a house that had a revolving door of SMW wrestlers as roommates. He mentions how gross the future Balls Mahonee was to live with and how they found a literal roach nest under his bed once. Jericho says Cornette should have given him a pig pen gimmick.

Jericho remembers how ""redneck"" the people coming to shows would look in some small towns, and specifically says he saw evidence of inbreeding in Hyden, Kentucky. He says he isn't trying to be judgemental, but calls it some ""pure Deliverance-type shit.""

Jericho puts over his time in SMW as valuable to developing his promo skills. He credits specifically Jim for working with him and making him a thousand times better, but also says he learnt a lot from Bullet Bob Armstrong, who was the on screen commisonare for SMW.

Chris got obsessed with the idea of doing the Shooting Star Press as a finisher and practiced it for weeks but could never get it right. The day of a big show where he was wrestling a marquee tag match, he was practicing the move when Jim told him to not hurt himself! Sure enough, Chris broke his arm and needed surgery. He lied to the doctor saying he was only ringside for the match, and the doc agreed to cast his arm and schedule surgery for the next morning. 

Needless to say, Jim was furious and screamed at Chris, but Chris assured Jim he would still wrestle with a broken arm. Chris calls this the stupidest decision of his entire career. (Wrestling hurt, not to practice that move the day of an important show) He says guys backstage like Terry Funk and Road Warrior Hawk were impressed by his courage and dumbfounded by his stupidity. Chris says that Cornette didn't care if he got hurt or not.

Chris says that because he hurt himself while practicing, Cornette refused to pay for the surgery. Chris notes that Jim didn't pay for the stitches Chris got that night so the reason seemed like bullshit to him.

Chris finished up with SMW and went to work for smaller companies in Japan, but despite his criticisms of Cornette and his time there, Jericho is greatful for the development he got there, especially in his promo work.

Jericho talks about working for Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling (FMW) in Japan and how that promotion had no rules and everything was No Dq and garbage matches. Chris said that he and Lance stood out for the wrong reasons there.

Chris describes FMW as being very low budget and some days they would be wrestling outside in a literal parking lot.

Chris talks about being back in Canada and waiting for a call back to FMW. He was jealous but happy when his friend Lenny St Clair got invited to FMW and debuted a new gimmick that got super over with FMW's hardcore, garbage style. This is where the gimmick of Dr. Luther was born. Luther fit right at home in FMW, while Chris was desperate for work anywhere.

Jericho became a little distressed when FMW wouldn't book him and he decided to try a bunch if wacky and silly gimmicks, including wrestling as Dr Luther's ""brother"" Hannibal, and even Luther asked him not to do that. It's funny that Luther was more succesful than Jericho in Japan. Jericho talks about finally wrestling Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, and finding a message on the wall that Luther had written for him, congratulating Chris on making it to that venue.

Chris eventually got a regular spot working for a promotion called ""Wrestling & Romance"" (WAR) and he noted how it seemed like a more professional and bigger version of FMW. 

Jericho remembers working again with Vampiro in WAR and being annoyed when he was tasked with putting Vampiro over. He pokes fun at Vampiro basing his gimmick around Muay Thai strikes that Chris claimed Vampiro had no idea how to preform correctly.

Jericho says Vampiro tried the same tricks he did in Mexico, like telling the promotor that Chris was super unhappy and didn't want to come to Japan again. Jericho talks about how it became Jericho bad mouthing Vampiro and Vampiro bad mouthing Jericho, until Jericho declared himself the winner because he ended up doing 24 tours with WAR, while Vampiro only did 4.

Jericho recalls Bob Backlund working for WAR as well and describes him as ""a bit of a nut case"" because he always wore a 3 piece suit. No exceptions. He also said Bob sometimes talked to himself and describes him as rude to people who he thought weren't very smart.

Chris says Bob Backlund would only sign autographs if the kid asking could name all the US president's in order. Remember they are in Japan and this is a ridiculous request. Chris says he saw a kid rattle them off correctly once and Bob was so impressed that he signed two autographs for the kid.

Chris describes a tour with WAR when Mil Mascaras was brought in and Chris had to put him over every single night. He said he hated it and the matches usually sucked. He recalls there 2nd to last match being shit, and how Mil cornered him after the match to scold Chris, telling him, ""Nobody cares about you. They care about me. Nobody paid to see you. They paid to see me. So tomorrow night for our last match, no more of your moves! Nobody want to see them!"" Jericho says he made sure to do every move he knew and apparently Mil never ever said another word to Chris and they never worked together again.

Chris was eventually asked by WAR office to be a liason to bring in foreign talent. Chris says he went for talented guys but also points out how he was mostly motivated by wanting to work and travel with his friends. He said Mexico and Germany were lonely experiences so he jumped at the chance to bring in guys like Lance Storm, Bret Como and of course, Dr Luther. He says the most fun he had in Japan was hanging out with Luther everyday since they had so much in common.

Jericho describes meeting Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown from Back to the Future!) at a gas station in Japan. Chris approached the legendary actor and misquoted the ""1.21 Gigawatts!"" line by saying it was ""88.8 Gigawatts!"" Apparently this just pissed Lloyd off and he scolded Chris for first off, quoting a line that literally every fan screams at him, and secondly, for getting the damn quote wrong! Apparently Luther hit it off with Christopher Lloyd, and the two of them chatted for several minutes while Chris waited awkwardly.

Jericho describes wrestling Chris Benoit for the first time in the Super J Cup tournament WAR put on in December 1995. He talked to Benoit about a bunch of ideas for spots and Benoit casually told him that he doesn't like to plan a lot, just go over 1 or 2 key details and call it in the ring. I personally miss this style of wrestling, most modern guys choreograph far too much in matches imo.

Back in Calgary between tours, Benoit came to stay at Jericho's house because Benoit was booked on the Stu Hart birthday celebration show. Jericho notes how it was strange that he was never booked on any of the sporadic local Hart shows while he was in Calgary.

Jericho went with Benoit to the show, where he ran into Bret Hart who was WWF Champion at the time. When Jericho mentioned he did a few tours in Mexico, Bret asked him if he knew any innovative pinning combinations he could use in his next ppv. Jericho says he did a fist pump when he saw Bret pin Davey Boy on ppv wit the move he showed him. Jericho remembers thinking, ""I may not be good enough to work for WWF, but I just showed the WWF Champion a new finishing move.""

Chris says he literally spent all of 1995, calling Paul Heyman once a week and always being told he is busy or wasn't there, even though Chris knew the guy on the phone was literally Paul, just pretending to be someone else. Chris kept calling every week though because guys like Chris Benoit and Perry Saturn were telling him that Paul wanted to bring Jericho into ECW.

When Chris finally got ahold of Paul at the end of 1995, thanks to Mick Foley, the first thing Paul said was, ""Chris, good to hear from you! I have been trying to get ahold of you all year!"" Chris knew from this moment that Paul was ""full of shit.""

Chris suspects he was brought into ECW because Paul just lost guys like Eddie Guerrero, Benoit and Steve Austin to the bigger promotions. But Heyman told Chris that he thinks he will be ECW Champion before long.

After reading Lita's book and seeing how she scoffed at the ECW locker room and commented on a lot of guys ""drinking the kool-aid"" it's funny to see Jericho essentially be one of those guys. He is smart enough to see that Paul is a great salesman, but not smart enough to not buy into it. It's actually kinda wild how he is self aware to the issues but doesn't see how he was just one of those guys feeding into it as well.

Jericho talks about recieving a $25 bonus from Paul one night and how it felt like $5,000 and motivated him to try harder. He happily drank the kool-aid. He notes how he never had a single paycheck from Paul bounce, as other guys claimed to have.

Chris mentions taping a match with RVD that was so bad, Paul found an excuse not to air it on TV, despite it intending to be Jericho and RVD's tv debut.

Chris literally compares Paul to Jim Jones and confirms that he ""drank that kool-aid"" up and was ""determined to make Reverend Paul. E proud!"" I wonder if I would be as judgemental had I not just read Lita describe how she scoffed at all this and called it bullshit that Paul wasn't paying these guys what they deserved.

Jericho says he ran into Eric Bishoff at a party, and Eric offered Jericho a job based solely on Benoit's recommendation. Jericho was floored by this and knew he couldn't say no. When he told Heyman, apparently Heyman already knew. Jericho is surprised by this and impressed by all of Heyman's spies. 

The ""party"" he met Eric at a party that was held specifically for the New Japan Pro Wrestling promoted the World Peace Festival, which featured wrestlers from all over the world. WCW was sending some guys there, including Chris Benoit, who invited Jericho. I'm pointing this out because Chris was at a party filled with wrestlers and promoters, but he was still shocked that his conversation with Eric Bishoff got back to Heyman? Paul didn't need spies. He just needed to know literally 1 person at that party. Jericho is continually impressed by Paul, and I keep contrasting that with Lita seeing right through him. 

Jericho says Paul wanted to put the ECW tv title on Jericho before he left to WCW, and Jericho seemed overwhelmed by this gesture, saying Paul didn't have to trust him like that.

But just like Lita, Jericho has examples of Paul fucking with him on his way out the door. He messed with Jericho on the day he was supposed to win the TV title by promising him plane tickets that weren't real and Jericho remembers getting so pissed off he was left a voice mail for Paul telling him to screw himself and that he doesn't want the damn title. Paul called him back and again pitched the same bullshit plane ticket story. In the end though, Jericho made the show and is pleased with the match where he won the tv title.

Jericho has a few example of Paul Heyman getting him ""bereavement"" plane tickets which means, Chris had to pretend a loved on had just died. Paul even supplied a fake doctors note in case someone got suspicious.

Jericho puts over how sad he was to leave to ECW, and says he cried when the crowd chanted ""please don't go"" in his final match. Jericho says Paul looked like his best friend had died when Jericho came back through the curtain.

Jericho talks about being offered deal from Eric Bishoff to come to WCW, then getting a call from Kevin Sullivan, who Chris says, ""arrogantly told me he wanted to book me for a try out to see what I can do. Tryout? I don't need no stinking tryout."" Chris was just trying to highlight the communication problem WCW suffered from, but fails to see how having an attitude like that only worked against him.

Chris remembers his meeting with Eric Bishoff, who sold Chris on being the WCW version of Shawn Michaels, but also pitched him to fued with Brad Armstrong. Jericho was confused by this idea of being the next HBK while fueding with a lower card guy. Jericho would spend his entire time in WCW, comparing himself to Shawn Michaels, all because of 1 dumb line from Bishoff.

Chris tells a heartbreaking story about his paralyzed mom asking Chris to take her for a ride in his convertible, which was out of character for her. He put it off till the next day, but got called into WCW and never gave her that drive. She would pass away before the opportunity ever came around again.

Jericho remembers being upset when WCW booked him as a babyface, and he remembers also being upset when he's debut match against Jerry Lynn, was only given 7 minutes of time, and that included the entrances and celebration. Jericho was used to doing 20 minutes at least in Japan and ECW.

Jericho says his WCW debut match with Lynn was awful and when he got to the back, Terry Taylor told him as much and asked him if that was his first match ever. Jericho tried to defend himself by saying since he was winning, he wanted to make sure Lynn got his stuff in too. Terry Taylor was pissed and scolded Jericho because this match wasn't about Lynn, it was about Jericho and he blew it. 

Jericho says Benoit pulled him aside later and also chastised him for his poor showing against Lynn. Benoit said that word in the locker room is that Jericho sucks. God, how bad was this match? Benoit also scolded Jericho for wearing a Tshirt and shorts to the tv tapings, saying, ""This is the big leagues, act like it!"" Jericho was brought in on Benoit's recommendation and I can imagine that only hurt Benoit's credibility backstage.

Jericho says his Nitro debut match was poorly booked, as Sullivan had Jericho and his opportunity get counted out when Jericho tried to help his opponent who was hurt outside the ring.

Jericho says he was given an interview after the match but was told to put over the NWO as top heels for most of his talking time. Jericho calls this ""Another self-burial.""

Jericho remembers Terry Taylor telling him that Bishoff loves him, but Chris thinks this made the booking committee work against him.

Jericho implies that Kevin Sullivan specifically was out to get him and ensure Chris didn't get over. He says Kevin ordered a Jericho vs Benoit ppv match to be primarily Benoit on offense and then scolded Jericho afterwards for not listening.

Jericho remembers doing house show loops wrestling Jerry Lynn in a series of fun matches, until Scott Hall confronted him and told Chris that none of the fans paid to see Jericho vs Lynn and they have no need to go 20 minutes every night. ""Do a short match and hit the showers.""

Jericho remembers a house show where the sound system wouldn't work, so Hall and Nash complained loudly about how, ""This would never happen in New York."" And they refused to even go to the ring until Sting and Randy Savage went out first and called their bluff.

Jericho complains how the first fued he had in WCW was against referee Nick Patrick, and Jericho again remembers comparing this Shawn Michaels.

Jericho describes the political shit storm that was backstage WCW and how even guys who were friendly towards him like Booker T scoffed at the idea of working with Jericho or Guerrero or Melanko. Jericho recalls Booker saying, ""I ain't no cruiserweight!"" 

Jericho remembers Kevin Sullivan asking him once, ""Why do you care so much about your match? No one else does. Just get in the ring and get it over with! This company is the Titanic heading for that iceberg."" Jericho is critical of Sullivan here, but after working middle management in WCW for so long, I can't blame him. Jericho says Flair overheard this and told Jericho never to stop caring about your match quality. I don't know how solid of advice that is in WCW because it wasn't going to help your career to put on a better match than whatever NWO was doing in the main event. That feels like bad advice, politically tbh.

Jericho recalls the infamous WCW talent meeting where Eric Bishoff fired an absent Ric Flair (Bishoff had given Flair the day off) and then declared that the WWF would be out of business in 6 months. Chris says it was clear that Eric had become the Hitler of pro wrestling, and he had lost his mind.

Jericho was told he would be winning the Cruiserweight title off Syxx (Sean Waltman/ XPac), but it wouldn't be on Nitro. It would be on a house show. And worse off, Jericho was only going to beat him after Waltman retained his title in a 20-minute match that night. This made zero sense considering Jericho is the babyface, and Waltman is the heel.

Jericho says he pleaded with Kevin Sullivan to give him some notable wins on Nitro to build him up before winning the title. Sullivan responded by booking Jericho in a 5 minute squash loss to Scott Hall.

To Scott Hall's credit, he went against the booking and put Jericho over in that match. It's not something Hall had to do in his position. But Jericho still shades Hall by pointing out that Jericho had to teach Hall how to do the inside cradle finish, despite having 10 years more experience than Jericho. After the match, Hall improved a neat down on Jericho that kinda sapped the heat away from the win, so I get why Jericho was still bitter.

Terry Taylor was the one who suggested Jericho start using a submission move, and since Jericho had recently used the Boston Crab in Japan, he found a new name for it and got a new finisher

Jericho remembers getting some boos and deciding to lean into it and starts carving out that heel persona that would become synonymous with him. He came up with all the catchphrases and promo work himself. It seems like the office didn't even notice Jericho turn himself heel.

Jericho says he started doing weird things in his matches to see if anyone in the office was even paying attention and notes how similar behavior under Vince McMahon would result in being fired immediately.

Jericho outs over his program with Dean Melanko that featured his legendary list of moves segment and later Chris called Dean taking the luchador mask off, as onr of the 3 loudest pops he has ever heard and says the only other comparable ones involve Stone Cold and the Rock. 

Jericho talks about an angle where they got his dad involved on WCW tv. Terry Taylor ultimately wanted Jericho's dad to turn heel on them, but both guys didn't like it. Jericho's dad was pretty much h done after WCW stiffed him on a payoff. 

Jericho complains about having some of the loudest crowd reactions in the company but no merchandise and points out how Rick Stiener has a shirt and he doesn't. Ultimately, Jericho designed a shirt up himself and got Bishoff to approve it.

Jericho talks about dating 2 different Nitro girls and how one time Eric Bishoff asked Jericho if he had ""banged them."" Jericho says he didn't answer even after Bishoff offered him a raise if it was true.

Jericho talks about teaming with Eddie Guerrero for months and says they were an amazing team and wanted to go further but WCW broke them up because, according to Jericho, they ""made the cardinal mistake of getting over on our own."" Jericho does say him and Eddie disagreed on their potential team name. Jericho liked ""North and South of the Border,"" but Eddie preferred the more creative title of ""Eh and Way.""

Jericho remembers a house show where Scott Hall once asked Bret Hart why he tries so hard when it's not on TV.

Jericho says Scott Hall seemed like he could be a nice guy, but a combination of this profession and substance abuse turned him into a bully. One time, he goaded Chris into getting upset and then told him ,""You got something to say? I'll put an end to your little Terry Taylor push."" And Jericho had to bite his tongue.

When Jericho won the WCW TV title, he was told he would be joining the NWO to do so. Jericho turned down that offer but still won the title thanks to NWO interference, with Bishoff saying they will figure out why later. They never addressed that again, though, which is a great example of how WCW booked.

Jericho talks about his ""program"" with Goldberg, which started by him beating up a little person who looked like Goldberg. Jericho didn't pitch this or think of it. He was just told to do it. The next day, a pissed off Goldberg found Jericho and told him, ""I hope it was worth it because you're gonna pay."" Apparently, Goldberg was legit hurt by the segment and made it clear that he blamed Jericho. Jericho attempted to pass the blame off, saying that he was just doing what he was told.

The next show, Jericho, was told to call out Goldberg even though he wasn't there. Again, Jericho did as he was told and called him out. Then Jericho went above and beyond and cut a scathing promo about being 2 - 0 against Goldberg and naming him ""Greenberg."" This is the part where Jericho can't pretend that he was just ""doing his job"" because no one told him to bury Goldberg on the mic like that. Goldberg had already made it clear to Jericho that he didn't like the segment, so why would Jericho think this wasn't going to backfire?

Jericho details how he found Ralphus, gave him the comically small t-shirt, wrote on it with marker, and how they parodied Goldberg to hilarious degree. It's genuinely super funny, and if you have never seen it, it's worth checking out. When Goldberg approached Jericho, again telling him to knock the angle off. He didn't care that it was super hot and got great reactions, Goldberg was clear to Jericho that he didn't do comedy. Jericho tried to argue that it's not comedy, which must have been difficult if Ralphus was standing there in his tiny shirt and big belly, though. Jericho tries to argue, ""It's not comedy,"" because the fans wanted to see it, but later added that he wanted to keep doing it because he was ""enjoying his comedy."" 

Jericho was stunned when he got to Nitro a week or two later and was told he would be squashed by Goldberg in 3 minutes. He genuinely asked Bishoff, ""What's the story gonna be?"" And Bishoff looked at him like he was speaking German and said; ""It's the same story Goldberg always tells."" Ultimately, Jericho was able to get the match canceled.

Jericho talks about Ralphus getting a bit of an ego, talking up girls ringside, and putting baby oil on his arms and stomach before going out. He says Ralphus was talking about getting a lawyer to negotiate his ""next contract,"" and Jericho didn't know what that meant since he wasn't on any contract. He got $500 for each time he was used, and the guy started showing up when Jericho didn't ask. Eventually, Jericho had to stop using him because he was getting huge cheers while Jericho was supposed to be a heel.

Finally, a decision was made, and Jericho would be squashed by Goldberg on Nitro in a couple of minutes. A pissed off Jericho was pulled into a room with Bishoff, Goldberg, and Hogan, who all had to talk him into losing. Jericho argued that he was okay losing. He just wanted it it be on ppv. Goldberg hated Jericho and said he wanted nothing to do with his comedy bullshit. Jericho tried to argue more, but he couldn't see the decision was made weeks ago. If the top star doesn't like you and doesn't like working with you, you can't force him if you're a perennial mid-carder. Jericho was literally pitching to lose to Goldberg on a ppv that Goldberg was already promised off. That's not the way to convince him imo.

At one point during the meeting, Goldberg argued that Jericho wouldn't last a minute in a shoot fight in the ring with him. Jericho responded by telling Goldberg he could take him down with one kick to the groin.

Jericho ultimately talked them into delaying the squash again, but later found the whole angle was abruptly canceled with no mention of it again. Jericho says this is when he knew he had no future at WCW.

Jericho does note that Hogan seemed to be on his side during that meeting, and later Hogan came and told Jericho privately that Jericho was correct in that argument and good for him for standing his ground. This makes Jericho feel much better, and he says that him and Hulk have been friends since then. That feels more like Hulk being the smartest politician in the company to me

Bishoff had a new contract ready for Jericho to sign, but Jericho was desperate to work elsewhere. So he called up Vince Russo (no word on how they knew each other here) and got a meeting with Vince McMahon. Jericho found himself at Vince's personal home, where he sat down with Vince McMahon, Vince Russo, Jim Ross, Bruce Pritchard, Ed Ferrara and Shane McMahon.

Jericho describes the meeting as relaxed and says, in hindsight, he can see that he was given the big pitch and hard sell.

Jericho and Vince agreed to a deal, but so had Jericho and Bishoff months prior. Now, when Jericho backed out of the WCW deal in favor of the WWF one, Bishoff was super pissed and yelled at him. Bishoff immediately took the TV title off Jericho, having him drop it to Konan.

Bishoff's angry response scared Jericho, so he turned to Kevin Nash for advice. Nash put him in touch with his and Hall's agent, Barry Bloom. That same Barry Bloom who still works as Jericho's agent to this day, as well as the agent to other notable talent like Young Bucks and Will Ospreay. Bloom has been in the wrestling business background for decades and may be one of the most influential guys in wrestling, despite having nothing to do with the product.

Jericho says he was initially worried about being involved in one of the WWF's more silly angles and wanted a veto power in his contract. He didn't get that but was promised by Vince that he wouldn't be asked to do anything too outrageous or too provocative.

Jericho talks about the origins of his band Fozzy. Which started out as Ozzy Osborne cover band called Fozzy Osborne. This I genuinely didn't know or forgot.

Jericho describes watching WWF ppv Over the Edge in 1999 with his future wife Jessica Lockhart. Jericho was enjoying time off between companies and wanted to check out a WWF show. He was pretty horrified to be sitting at home like a fan watching on TV the night Owen Hart fell to his death. He remembers calling Benoit and leaving a voice mail asking him, ""What do we do now?""

Chris describes going to Owen's funeral and running into Hulk Hogan. Hulk flat out asked Jericho if he was going to work for WWF. When Chris said yes, Hogan responded with, ""Can you take me with you?""

Jericho says the Y2J gimmick and countdown clock were all his ideas and that Vince loved them. Though he says the specific ""Y2J"" name was intended as the name of his finishing move, having it called ""The Y2J Problem."" Vince liked the idea but changed it, so ""Y2J"" was his name. 

Jericho was floored when he was told he would be debuting in a segment with The Rock.

changemyview,1fgobko,"CMV: If you support Trump, you don't care about our country","With all the information out there, I don't understand how anybody could support Trump if they have the countries best interests in mind. My biggest issue with Trump is the Jan 6th insurrection and fake elector scheme in which he tried to essentially overrule the will of the voters and the constitution.

Not only does he not regret anything that happen that day, but he still doesn't admit he lost and just continues to lie saying the election was stolen (there is no evidence of such). He also wants to pardon the Jan 6th rioters, he hired a VP in Vance who said he WOULD NOT have certified the vote if he was in Mike Pence's shoes which would have meant overruling the guardrails holding our democracy in place. He is also saying that THIS upcoming election is already rigged, so why does anybody give him the benefit of the doubt that he would put the constitution above his own selfish interests in any scenario? This is also a man who threatens to jail anybody who participated in the 2020 election ""fraud"" in which he lost every single court case and there is no evidence. Moreover the supreme court ruling essentially giving presidents immunity is very disconcerting to me.

How can any voter in good conscious vote for someone like Trump knowing this? I'm not even going to get into Trump rhetoric and obvious selfishness because I think my view is strong enough just based on the Jan 6th/Fake elector scheme event.

Whether you blindly support Trump, or just play team sports and vote for your party no matter the candidate, you don't truly care about the country because either A.

Presidentialpoll,1fgo14c,"One Shot, Two Shot, Three Shot | American Interflow Timeline","A war that had begun with the promise of swift suppression had spiraled into a nationwide conflict. The revolutionaries, led by the idealistic yet increasingly embattled Eugene V. Debs, had rallied millions to their cause, rejecting the outcome of the Election of 1908 as an autocratic plot to kill the new vision Debs had for the country at its infancy. However, as the brutal winter of 1910 passed, famine, violence, and civil strife tore the revolutionary-controlled states apart. Likewise**, the federal government nearly shattered itself after the following assassination of President George von Lengerke Meyer**. Photos of Meyer's burnt and charred body on the aftermath of the assassination tore threw public circles through backdoor sales, instilling a sense of terror and fear throughout public life. Meyer's successor, Hamilton Fish II, was clearly more willing accept the increasingly authoritarian policies being pushed through by the Bootspitters and other uncompromising individuals. Fish had signed off in the usage of aircraft as a tool of war and the destruction of Revie supply lines and sustenance sources. Critics of the president claim that Fish's tilt to the increasingly aggressive and unempathetic likes of James Vardaman, Thomas W. Wilson, Nicholas Butler, John Nance Garner, and others has led to the ""**Winter of Harrows**"", the great famine that swept across the revolutionary-controlled areas that **claimed the lives of over 300,000 people**. Other issues, such a**s the continued failure on the identification of the true culprit of President Meyer's assassination and the power of monopolies regarding war production**, had led many to turn their backs on the current handling of the administration. An investigation found by the Bureau of Public Safety uncovered that Standard Oil, the mega-monopoly ran by the Rockefeller family and now headed by New York Governor John D. Rockefeller Jr., **had profited over $440,000 dollars with manufacturing contracts** regarding war production from private dealings with Secretary of Sustenance Harvey S. Firestone. The scheme implicated many major monopolizes such as Carnegie, Clay, and Morgan, who's combined wealth with assets amassed nearly 7% of the US GDP and had stakes or directly controlled over 66% of all US businesses. The following scandal and multiple years of unaddressed business power would birthed out the [Phelan-Butler Antitrust Bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/1fdhjeh/comment/lmfqw49/), a bi-partisan effort to finally quash down on monopoly influence.   


As the bill's fate was being determined in Congress, political travesty would soon engulf the administration. Secretary of State Oscar Underwood would make multiple foreign trips around the globe to secure foreign neutrality and diplomatic support for the Freds. However, Underwood would enter in a spat with Attorney General James R. Garfield, who decried Underwood for visiting nations such as Russia and Germany, empires who had threatened the US' internal security during the Chaffee administration and were committing horrendous acts on its colonial subjects and minorities within its empire. Underwood would counter-back against Garfield by stating that as Attorney General, Garfield had ineffectively handling both revolutionary spies and foreign agents within the country. Enraged by the accusations, Garfield would resign his position as Attorney General, stating ""**the administration detachment from the tasks the people bestows upon it**"". Garfield's resignation would be followed by a similar resignation from Secretary of Labor and Employment Chauncey Depew, whom stated his distain of the administration's ""**shift towards ruthless endeavors**"". Following this, Senator C.C. Young of California and Representative John F. Fitzgerald would call for **an impeachment inquiry to be launched against President Fish**, in plausible abuses of power and inhumane conduct regarding the war effort. The ensuing fallout would cause a shift in Fish's personal feelings regarding the war, while once being staunchly adamant of seeking an unconditional surrender against the revolutionaries, Fish now became open for seeking a compromise— even possible extreme reconciliation— to end this hellish conflict once and for war. With revolutionary President Eugene V. Debs **opened for the idea of peace with conditions guaranteeing the safety of those who sided with the revolution**, time was ticking on the Freds' actions. Within the halls of power, three competing visions for ending the conflict emerged, each reflecting a different philosophy on governance, reconciliation, and justice. These proposals—each distinct in its approach—would determine the fate of not only the revolutionaries but also the future of the United States itself.

 **The Hoover Proposal**

Herbert Hoover, the pragmatic humanitarian advisor to former President Meyer and President Fish, had watched the war with growing concern. For Hoover, it was not just a matter of military victory, but of healing a nation torn apart by division. Hoover had been one of the first to recognize the catastrophic impact of famine in the revolutionary territories, and his efforts to feed civilians, even in enemy-controlled regions, had earned him a reputation as a voice of compassion amidst the chaos of war. Hoover’s proposal, known simply as ""**The Hoover Proposal**,"" called for an immediate cessation of hostilities through a negotiated peace. His plan was built upon three pillars: **pardon**, **reform**, and **restriction**.

First, Hoover advocated for **full pardons** for all revolutionaries and civilian collaborators, fulfilling one of the conditions asked by Debs in his plea. He believed that punishing the revolutionaries would only sow the seeds of future rebellions. ""**We cannot afford to make martyrs of these men and women**,"" Hoover had warned President Fish in a letter. ""**If we treat them as enemies long after their surrender, we risk perpetuating the divisions that led to this conflict in the first place.**"" In exchange for these pardons, Hoover proposed an ambitious reform to the Constitution: the introduction of a **“Second Bill of Rights.”** Hoover would collaborate with multiple figures across the aisle, such as Henry George Jr., C.C. Young, James R. Garfield, William Borah, and Bob La Follette, to draft up the contents of this groundbreaking document that would drastically alter the constitution. It would go as follows:  


**Article I: Right to Equal Voting**  
*Every citizen of the United States, upon reaching the age of eighteen, shall have the right to vote in all federal, state, and local elections, regardless of gender, race, color, ethnicity, social class, employment status, or place of residence. No law shall infringe upon or unduly burden this right. Voting shall be free, fair, and accessible, with provisions made for early voting, absentee ballots, and protections for disenfranchised communities.*   


**Article II: Right to Employment**  
*Every person capable of work shall have the right to a job, with fair wages that provide for a dignified standard of living. The federal government shall ensure employment opportunities through public works programs, infrastructure projects, and partnerships with private industry. No person shall be forced into unemployment by economic misfortune or systemic inequality.*  


**Article III: Right to a Living Wage**  
*Every person who is employed has the right to receive a living wage sufficient to meet basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, education, and other necessities. The minimum wage shall be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the cost of living and ensure that all working Americans can provide for themselves and their families.*   


**Article IV: Right to Housing**  
*Every citizen has the right to secure, affordable, and decent housing. The federal government shall work in partnership with states and municipalities to provide affordable housing options, prevent homelessness, and ensure that all Americans have a place to live in dignity and security.*   


**Article V: Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining**  
*Every worker shall have the right to form, join, or assist labor unions, and to bargain collectively for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. No law or employer shall abridge this right, and the federal government shall protect unions from intimidation, retaliation, or interference.*   


**Article VI: Right to Fair and Just Taxation**  
*All taxation shall be structured so that it is progressive, with higher income earners paying a greater share of taxes. No American shall be overburdened by taxation, and the system shall ensure that resources are distributed equitably to support public goods such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social services.*   


**Article VII: Right to Fiscal Responsibility**  
*Annual federal expenditures shall not exceed annual federal revenues, except in times of declared national emergency, war, or economic crisis, as determined by a two-thirds majority vote of both houses of Congress. All federal budget proposals and final spending reports must be made available to the public, ensuring transparency and allowing citizens to review the government's fiscal policies. This information must be accessible in clear, comprehensible formats. Any citizen may bring a lawsuit against the federal government if it is determined that the government has willfully violated the balanced budget requirement without invoking one of the designated exceptions. Such lawsuits shall be heard in federal courts, and remedies may include fiscal penalties or forced budget corrections.*

Hoover saw this as a way to address the legitimate grievances of the people while keeping the federal government firmly in control, while the extreme measures composed were even against Hoover's own personal views, he accepted it out of necessity for peace. However, Hoover also understood the need to protect the integrity of the government. Noting how shockingly progressive and ""radical"" his proposed Second Bill of Rights may be, he would pave another clause that would appease those weary of it. Under his proposal, **no former revolutionary** would be allowed to seek public office for **15 years**. This cooling-off period, Hoover argued, would prevent former insurgents from immediately entering positions of power and destabilizing the fragile peace. ""**We must give them time to reintegrate as citizens before we trust them with the levers of power**,"" Hoover explained. Hoover would also sneakily add a proviso in his proposal without catching the eyes of many. Hoover would include a clause in his overall proposal that would make ""**North American English**"" the official language of the United States. This move was made to appease the nativists in government, who were disgruntled after former President Meyer's immigrant reform acts. Though idealistic, Hoover’s plan was not without its critics. Many in the government, particularly the military, viewed his proposal as overly lenient. They feared that by pardoning the revolutionaries and adopting their demands for reform, the federal government would appear weak. However, Hoover’s supporters, including several key senators, argued that his approach would ensure long-term peace and prevent the rise of new insurgencies. ""**A just peace is better than a bitter victory**,"" Hoover often said.

[Chief of the War Department's Food and Humanitarian activities, Herbert Hoover](https://preview.redd.it/0zc9kjnhnrod1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dcf323a7b747366763257466d76c3e9a5912413)

**The Firestone Proposal**  


Standing in stark contrast to Hoover’s vision was the proposal of none other than Secretary of Sustenance Harvey S. Firestone. While embroiled in his own personal scandals regarding his ties with monopolies, he would continue to be one of the largest advocates for the total surrender of the Revies in government. Firestone was a seasoned businessman and negotiator, hardened by years of brutal fighting of both in the battlefield and in business, and his views on how to end the revolution were simple: **unconditional surrender** or **total annihilation**. Firestone’s proposal, which came to be known as ""**The Firestone Proposal**,"" rejected any notion of compromise with the revolutionaries. He believed that negotiating with the likes of Eugene Debs was not only dangerous but also a betrayal of the sacrifices made by federal soldiers. ""To negotiate with traitors is to admit that treason can be rewarded,"" Firestone had famously declared during a meeting with Fish’s war council. ""**We must show them that rebellion against the United States is futile and will be met with the full force of our military might.**"" Under Firestone’s plan, the federal government would issue a final ultimatum to the revolutionaries: **surrender unconditionally** or face the complete destruction of their forces. There would be no pardon for civilians who had collaborated with the revolutionaries unless they **personally surrendered** to federal authorities and **swore allegiance** to the government. Those who failed to do so would be treated as traitors and punished accordingly.  

After the expected unconditional surrender of the revolutionary forces under the Firestone Proposal, the federal government would move swiftly to divide the revolutionary territories into four **occupation zones**. The purpose of these zones would be to reestablish order, maintain control, and ensure that no revolutionary sentiment or resurgence could rise again. Each zone would be administered by a high-ranking official, with broad powers over military, economic, and civil matters. Firestone, the architect of the proposal, would oversee the implementation and coordination of the zones, ensuring unified federal control over the once-revolutionary regions. The four occupation zones would be governed by individuals with specific expertise and the federal government's confidence to handle the monumental task of pacification and reconstruction. Each of these leaders—Firestone himself, Representative Henry Ford, Chief of Staff of the Army Leonard Wood, and Representative Charles August Lindbergh—would manage their assigned territories with distinct but complementary strategies aimed at bringing the regions back into alignment with federal control while ensuring that the Revies' influence was permanently eradicated.  


While each zone would be governed independently by its respective leader, Firestone would maintain overall coordination between the zones. A central federal administration office would be established to ensure consistency in policy enforcement, resource allocation, and intelligence-sharing. All areas under occupation would enter in martial law and be under the direct protection and security of the US armed forces. Secretary of National Defense John Jacob Astor IV would act as the final authority on disputes between the zones, ensuring that the occupation remained effective and unified. Each leader would report directly to the President and the War Department, ensuring federal oversight and preventing any independent power bases from forming in the occupied territories. The President himself would also oversee the establishment of federal courts within each zone. Firestone’s proposal also included a **permanent ban** on any former revolutionary or collaborator from seeking **nationwide office**. Unlike Hoover’s 15-year restriction, Firestone sought a lifetime ban, ensuring that no one associated with the revolution would ever hold power again. ""**They may surrender, but they will never rule, and we shall make sure that is our status quo,**"" Firestone stated.

His plan was, in essence, a continuation of the war through different means. Rather than focusing on reconciliation, Firestone believed that the revolutionaries needed to be crushed to ensure that no similar uprising would ever occur again. While Firestone’s approach was harsh, it appealed to many within the military and among Boospitter politicians who believed that anything short of total victory would undermine the authority of the federal government. It would receiving backing by Senators Wilson, Vardaman, Butler, Law, and Phelan, with fiery types such as Public Safety Secretary John Calvin Coolidge, William Randolph Hearst, and the Hancockian leadership also supporting its contents. Firestone’s critics, however, warned that his proposal could prolong the conflict. With food shortages and civilian suffering already widespread, further military action could result in even greater loss of life. Moreover, some feared that a heavy-handed approach would drive the remaining revolutionaries underground, leading to years of guerrilla warfare. But for Firestone and his supporters, the only acceptable end to the revolution was complete and unambiguous submission.

**The Hitchcock Proposal**  


The third and final proposal came from Senator Gilbert Hitchcock, a reconciliationist, Visionary, and a long-time advocate for peace with the Revies. Following the assassination of Senator William Jennings Bryan along with President Meyer in San Antonio, Hitchcock was chosen to be Bryan's replacement for Nebraska. Hitchcock had been following the conflict closely and had maintained quiet channels of communication with both federal officials and revolutionary sympathizers without the knownledge of many of his peers. He believed that the war had reached a point where neither side could claim outright victory, and that only a negotiated settlement could bring about lasting peace. The ""**Hitchcock Proposal**,"" was built on the idea of **compromise** and **shared power**. He supported Debs’ call for peace talks and offered a path forward that would allow both the federal government and the revolutionaries to claim a measure of success. Central to Hitchcock’s plan was the **pardon of all revolutionary collaborators**, a point on which he agreed with both Debs and Hoover. However, unlike Hoover’s plan, Hitchcock proposed that **no restrictions** be placed on former revolutionaries’ ability to seek public office. He believed that reconciliation required full reintegration into the political system, and that barring former revolutionaries from public life would only deepen the divisions within the country. Hitchcock had **collaborated on this plan with the likes of Seymour Stedman, Clarence Darrow, and Adolph F. Germer**, socialists yet ones that had not defected to the Revolutionary Authority.

To address the concerns of the federal government and the military, Hitchcock proposed a **second constitutional convention** that would include representatives from the revolutionary and socialist factions. This convention would revise the Constitution to reflect the demands of the revolutionaries, with the diverse representation being a bid to instill the end of the grievances of the Revies and to the implement their own policy proposals to the country. ""**We must not merely end the war**,"" Hitchcock argued, ""**but build a new nation on the ashes of the old. If we ignore the voices of the people, we risk igniting yet another conflict.**""

Hitchcock’s proposal was the most radical of the three, as it envisioned a true partnership between the federal government and the revolutionaries in shaping the future of the country. While his plan would end the war through diplomacy, it also recognized the need for systemic change to prevent future uprisings. By allowing former revolutionaries to seek office and participate in the new constitutional convention, Hitchcock hoped **to create a more inclusive, tolerant, and just government**. However, his proposal faced fierce opposition from hardliners and military leaders who viewed it as capitulation. They feared that by allowing revolutionary representation, the federal government would be seen as weak and that socialist ideals would take root in the nation's political institutions. Many Homelanders viewed Hitchcock's plan was **adjutant to relinquishing federal power to the Revies**, after a war they would have clearly lost. Hitchcock’s supporters, on the other hand, believed that only by embracing these ideals could the country move forward without further bloodshed.

AfricaVoice,1fgnvk1,"Biden to make first Africa visit with Angola trip in coming weeks, sources say. ","[Link](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/us/2024/09/13/biden-to-make-first-africa-visit-with-angola-trip-in-coming-weeks-sources-say/)



President Joe Biden is planning a trip to Angola in the coming weeks, fulfilling a promise that would make him the first US head of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa since Barack Obama in 2015, three sources told Reuters.

The trip, which is being finalised, is likely to occur after the UN General Assembly meeting in September and before the November 5 presidential election, one source said.

The White House declined to comment to Reuters on the trip plans.

Mr Biden had hoped to visit Angola late last year but the trip was postponed after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October.

Mr Biden has pledged closer US partnership with democracies on the African continent, as China invests heavily in the region.

The Democratic President hosted Angolan President Joao Lourenco at the White House last November and raised the prospect of a visit during their Oval Office meeting. In May, he said he planned to make an official visit to Africa in February if he won the US presidential election.

Mr Biden would be the first US president to visit the oil- and resource-rich African country, one of the sources said, following a first visit by a US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, in September 2023.

Keen to counter China's investments in Africa, the US has been supporting a project that links resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo to Angola's Lobito port by rail to bypass road congestion on the copper and cobalt route.

Mr Biden, who took office in 2021, has faced some criticism for not visiting the African continent earlier in his term after hosting a US-African leaders summit in Washington in December 2022. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Africa in 2023, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken did this year.

Mr Biden's trip would come weeks before a US presidential election that remains tight, with recent polls showing Democratic candidate Ms Harris tied with her Republican rival, former president Donald Trump, whose derogatory reference to African nations continues to reverberate in African diplomatic circles.

Eritrea,1fgns6d,President Isaias Afwerki meets Egyptian Foreign Minister in Asmara today,"“President Isaias Afwerki met, in the early afternoon hours today at Denden Guest House, Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister, Dr. Badr Abdelatty.

In the extensive meeting - which is part and parcel of the periodic Consultative Forums that both countries hold in Asmara and Cairo respectively - the two sides discussed in greater depth, bilateral matters and regional issues of mutual importance; especially current developments in the Sudan, the Federal Republic of Somalia, as well as, the security of the Red Sea.

The two sides underlined that enhancement of the bilateral ties between Eritrea and Egypt constitutes one of the key pillars of regional peace and stability. In this respect, both sides agreed to further upgrade the prevailing bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the economic, political, trade, agricultural, energy and health sectors.

The two sides categorically noted that Egypt does not espouse an agenda of regional destabilization and interference. Misconstruing these facts to peddle unwarranted statements and accusations by some quarters is thus hollow and merely invoked to rationalize their strategic mistakes.

Speaking to national media outlets, Dr. Badr Abdelatty remarked that President Isaias has a deep and profound knowledge of the history and development of the region, and that the meeting was particularly helpful and constructive given the current sensitive times.

The meeting was attended by Mr. Osman Saleh, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea, and on the Egyptian side by Mr. Abbas Kamel, head of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, and Mr. Mohamed Hatem el-Atawy, Ambassador of Egypt in Eritrea.”",stenmored,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eritrea/comments/1fgns6d/president_isaias_afwerki_meets_egyptian_foreign/,/r/Eritrea/comments/1fgns6d/president_isaias_afwerki_meets_egyptian_foreign/,4,2024-09-14 14:49:31,4,,False,1.0,None,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710
GiftofGames,1fgnotm,"[REQUEST][STEAM] Black Myth: Wukong (6th attempt)
","I was ready to buy the game when it launched, but sadly the revolution that was happening in my country Bangladesh just ended and 1 of the biggest crimes that was committed was stealing 5B$s which made dollar price shot up, which isn't an issue I can pay 75$s instead of 60$s but here's the bigger problem that I and most people didn't consider the inflation. Egg price was 70tk now it's 160tk (For foreigners you can look it up on chaaldal). Same with every other thing and now this makes it impossible for me to afford any luxury from now on. So if anyone cares to help I can answer any questions for you. Here are some general question answers. Why do you have 72 games in your account privated?

Most of those games are from steamgifts and 100% off steam games. I can make them public and show them

What was the revolution about?

You can google it Bangladesh revolution 2024. It's like the Sri Lanka revolution where a president just never gave up her position a kept leaching

How much is dollar price?

in 2020 it was 81tk to 1usd

in 2023 it was 108tk to 1usd

Now it's 120

Here's the questions that were asked here

Why don't I sell my inventory?

It's worth like 2$ at most without steam tax

Why don't I get a loan

I don't have anyone that would loan me

I don't know if this is a begging subreddit or not but I m using this place as a last resort. I mean if I could save 5$s a month currently I wouldn't be here but as this is true for every country with inflation pay rate doesn't magically increase

I don't even have an international bank card so I have to pay 500tk (5 usd) to local people that have connections over sea

If you have other questions please comment them

HeatherCoxRichardson,1fgniyw,"September 14, 2024","After bomb threats today, officials had to evacuate two elementary schools in Springfield, Ohio, and move the students to a different location. They had to close a middle school altogether. This is the second day bomb threats have closed schools and public buildings after MAGA Republicans have spread the lie that Haitian immigrants there have been eating white people's pets. Haitian immigrants, who were welcomed to Springfield by officials eager to revitalize the city and who are there legally, say they are afraid. 

Hunter Walker and Josh Kovensky of *Talking Points Memo* today explained where the lie had come from and how it had spread. More than two months ago, they wrote, Ohio senator J.D. Vance, who is Trump’s vice presidential running mate, began to speak about Springfield at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, trying to tie rising housing prices to immigrants. The next day, at the National Conservatism conference, Vance accused “illegals” of overwhelming the city. 

On August 10, about a dozen neo-Nazis of the “Blood Tribe” organization showed up in Springfield, where one of their leaders said the city had been taken over by “degenerate third worlders” and blamed the Jews for the influx of migrants. The neo-Nazis stayed and, on August 27, showed up at a meeting of the city council, where their leader threatened council members. On September 1, another white supremacist group, Patriot Front, held its own “protest to the mass influx of unassimilable Haitian migrants” in the city. Right-wing social media posters pushed the story, usually with “witnesses” to events in the city coming from elsewhere.

In late August, posting in a private Facebook group, a resident said they had heard that Haitian immigrants had butchered a neighbor’s cat for food. Vance reposted that rumor to attack Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, on whom he is trying to hang undocumented immigration although it was Trump who convinced Republicans to kill a strong bipartisan border bill this spring. Springfield police and the city manager told news outlets there was no truth to the rumors.  

Nonetheless, on September 10, Vance told his people to “keep the cat memes flowing,” even though—or perhaps because—the rumors were putting people in his own state in danger.

Trump repeated the lie at the presidential debate that night, claiming, “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there.” Today, President Joe Biden demanded Trump stop his attacks on Haitian-Americans, but Trump doubled down, promising to deport the Haitian immigrants in Springfield if he is elected, although they are here legally. 

The widespread ridicule of Trump’s statement has obscured that this attack on Ohio’s immigrants is part of an attempt to regain control of the Senate. Convincing Ohio voters that the immigrants in their midst are subhuman could help Republicans defeat popular Democratic incumbent senator Sherrod Brown, who has held his seat since 2007. Brown and Montana’s Jon Tester, both Democrats in states that supported Trump in 2020, are key to controlling the Senate. 

Two Republican super PACs, one of which is linked to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have booked more than $82 million of ad space in Ohio between Labor Day and the election and are focusing on immigration. 

Taking control of the Senate would enable Republicans not only to block all popular Democratic legislation, as they did with gun reform after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, but to continue to establish control of America’s judicial system. So long as their judges are in place to make law from the bench, what the majority of Americans want doesn’t matter.

In 1986, when it was clear that most Americans did not support the policies put in place by the Reagan Republicans, the Reagan appointees at the Justice Department broke tradition to ensure that candidates for judgeships shared their partisanship. Their goal, said the president’s attorney general, Ed Meese, was to “institutionalize the Reagan revolution so it can’t be set aside no matter what happens in future presidential elections.” 

That principle held going forward. Federal judgeships depend on Senate confirmation, and when McConnell became Senate minority leader in 2007, he worked to make sure Democrats could not put their own appointees onto the bench. He held up so many of President Barack Obama’s nominees for federal judgeships that in 2013 Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) prohibited filibusters on certain judicial nominees.

McConnell also made it clear that he would do everything he could to make sure that Democrats could not pass laws, weaponizing the filibuster so that nothing could become law without 60 votes in the Senate.

McConnell became Senate majority leader in 2015 when voters gave Republicans control of the Senate, and when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell refused even to hold hearings for President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. McConnell’s justification for this unprecedented obstruction was that Obama’s March nomination was too close to an election, but the underlying reason for the 2016 delay was at least in part his recognition that hopes of pushing the Supreme Court to the right, especially on the issue of abortion, were likely to get evangelical voters to the polls.

Trump won in 2016, and Republicans got control of the Senate. In 2017, when Democrats tried to filibuster Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia’s long-empty seat, then–majority leader McConnell killed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The end of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees meant that McConnell could push through Trump’s nominees Brett Kavanaugh, with just 50 votes, and Amy Coney Barrett, with just 52 (in late October 2020, with voting for the next president already underway). 

Throughout his tenure as Senate majority leader, McConnell made judicial confirmations a top priority, churning through nominations even when the coronavirus pandemic shut everything else down. Right-wing plaintiffs are now seeking out those judges, like Matthew Kacsmaryk of Texas, to decide in their favor. Kacsmaryk challenged the FDA’s approval of the drug mifepristone, which can be used in abortions, thus threatening to ban it nationwide.

Meanwhile, at the Supreme Court, Trump appointees are joining with right-wing justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito to overturn precedents established long ago, including the right to abortion. 

Controlling the country through the courts was the plan behind stacking the courts with Republican nominees and weaponizing the filibuster to stop Democrats from passing legislation. In March 2024, in *Slate*, legal analyst Mark Joseph Stern noted that McConnell “realized you don’t need to win elections to enact Republican policy. You don’t need to change hearts and minds. You don’t need to push ballot initiatives or win over the views of the people. All you have to do is stack the courts. You only need 51 votes in the Senate to stack the courts with far-right partisan activists…\[a\]nd they will enact Republican policies under the guise of judicial review, policies that could never pass through the democratic process. And those policies will be bulletproof, because they will be called ‘law.’”

When he took office, President Joe Biden went to work putting his own mark on the federal judiciary. Almost two thirds of his appointees are women, and 62% are people of color. He appointed the first Black female justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the Supreme Court. But now, Republicans are hoping to retake the Senate to make sure that those appointments will stop, along with any more legislation. Their right-wing appointees to the courts will take the business of lawmaking out of the hands of American majorities.

Republican leaders are throwing everything they’ve got at the Senate races in Montana and Ohio, where they hope they can pick up the seat they need to take control of the Senate.

Attacks on immigrants in Ohio might move that needle. 

In 1890, Republicans faced a similar problem. They had lost the popular vote in 1888, although they installed Republican president Benjamin Harrison in office through the Electoral College, and knew the Democrats would soon far outnumber their own voters. So they set out to guarantee that they could never lose the Senate, which should enable them to kill popular Democratic legislation. 

But they misjudged the electorate, and in the 1890 midterm election, voters gave control of the House to the Democrats by a margin of two to one, and control of the Senate came down to a single seat, that of a senator from South Dakota. In those days, state legislatures chose their state’s senators, and shortly after it became clear that control of the Senate was going to depend on that South Dakota seat, U.S. Army troops went to South Dakota to rally voters by putting down an “Indian uprising” in which no people had died and no property had been damaged. 

Fueled on false stories of “savages” who were attacking white settlers, the inexperienced soldiers were the ones who pulled the triggers to kill more than 250 Lakotas on December 29, but the Wounded Knee Massacre started in Washington, D.C.

In 2023 we filed personal extensions for our tax returns that included estimated payments of $10k each. We agreed that this money will be paid by the company since neither of us had that kind of personal cash. Unknown to me (since I am not CFO and put trust in this position to account for all thing financial), this money was seen by the accountant as distributions. I have evidence of conversations between the accountant and the CFO that the pro-rata differences in distribution must be paid back to the company and that it is in the financial records as a loan from shareholder CFO. I was not aware of this conversation, nor aware that the CFO had agreed to this option of a loan. Our operating agreement does not have anything specific regarding loans from the company, but our Buy-Sell agreement states that any loan of over $5k must be voted on and approved by all members.

Would this be considered a breach of contract?

MarkMyWords,1fgn9j3,MMW: Elon Musk will be the new DJT ,"As the old wounded silverback slinks off dejectedly to his lair in Mar-a-Lago, his admirer/fellow fascist technobro, the world’s most fecund gazillionaire, is not exactly distraught at the glorious leader's decline. Nope. Instead, Musk is drooling at the thought of assuming Trump's de facto leadership of the right. He knows that the best bet for his fantasy of ""absolute free speech"" and unfettered development of AI, body augmentation, and other new technologies is to take over the reins of government. Indeed, all the evidence you need is “Leon’s” deal with Trump for a position as *Director Of Government Efficiency* (DOGE—geddit? yuk, yuk) if Trump gets elected. With his wealth, social reach and extreme right wing views, there is no-one better placed than Musk to step into Trump's old, weird shoes. Musk is relatively young, so four years of a Democrat presidency will simply give him enough time to hone his messaging, build his audience, and strategize his big power plays to become Trump 2.0. Here’s a summary of their similarities:   

* **Divisive obnoxious personalities:** Both share outspoken and often polarizing public personas.
* **Overwhelming social media presence:** Both are all over social media, particularly Twitter/X (Musk), as their main way to reach supporters.
* **Disruptive:** Both are disruptors in their respective fields—Trump in politics and Musk in technology.
* **Huge following:** Both have fanatical fan bases and their supporters see them as charismatic.
* **Over-confident and self-assured:** Both exhibit extreme over-confidence in their own abilities and capability to make wise decisions.
* **Hate of traditional media:** Both have been vocal opponents of mainstream media.
* **Unpredictability:** Their actions and statements are often unpredictable, keeping others off-balance.
* **Favor workforce reductions:** Trump has praised Musk's significant staff cuts at Twitter/X as a model for efficiency. 
* **Hate of government scrutiny:** Musk's companies continues to face investigations from various government agencies, similar to the scrutiny Trump faces—leading to their claims of victimhood as well as resentment among supporters.
* **Fascist and misogynist views:** In the past year, Musk has shown increasing alignment with Trump's extremist political positions. Like Trump he has demeaned and denigrated women with no accountability. 
* **Objectionable statements:** Both have a history of making outrageous, provocative and hence controversial and widely distributed public statements.
* **Business background:** They’re both business/entertainment-oriented rather than having traditional political or public service careers.
* **Interest in government efficiency:** Trump has endorsed Musk's idea for a government efficiency commission.

WeirdWheels,1fgn6tm,"The Alfa-Romeo 2300, AKA: Alfa-Romeo Rio. An Alfa-Romeo that was made exclusively for Brazil and was in fact the first ever Alfa-Romeo to be produced outside of Italy. Long post.","THE BEGINNING

The history of Alfa-Romeo in Brazil began in the 1950s, when it entered into a partnership with FNM (Fábrica Nacional de Motores - national engine factory), an industry created during the Second World War to produce aircraft engines, to produce the famous FNM trucks, which became famous for their robustness and power.

Ten years later, in the 1960s, taking advantage of strong government support, FNM teamed up with Alfa-Romeo again to produce a car based on the Alfa-Romeo 2000 in Brazil to pay tribute to then-president Juscelino Kubitschek. The car was named FNM 2000 JK.

In 1968, FNM, until then a state-owned company of the Brazilian government, was sold to Alfa-Romeo, which continued production of the FNM 2000 and later the FNM 2150 until 1973, when it finally took control of the shares in Brazil.

Wasting little time, Alfa-Romeo began designing a new car exclusively for the Brazilian market.

Based on the Italian model Alfa-Romeo Alfetta 2000, the new Brazilian car would be a sedan with a modern design, reliable mechanics and the same luxury as any other Alfa-Romeo car.

On March 25, 1974, the Alfa-Romeo 2300 was launched, a four-door sedan that, despite being designed in Italy, was developed exclusively for the Brazilian market, thus having the slogan: “The imported car manufactured in Brazil”

The launch of the car was a milestone for Alfa-Romeo, as it was the first Alfa-Romeo car to be manufactured outside of Italy.

The new Alfa-Romeo 2300 arrived to compete in the competitive luxury car segment, which included high-end models such as the Dodge Dart and Ford Galaxie.

Modern and refined for its time, the new sedan featured equipment that was previously unheard of in the Brazilian market..

With an elegant look, with formal and simple lines, following the trend of European cars of the time, with a predominance of straight lines, a large glazed area and a high and imposing rear. At the front, the four round headlights were the trademark of Alfa-Romeo models. The side lines were simple and unadorned. The taillights were small and rectangular, in red, orange and white, which would only become mandatory in Brazil ten years later, this design set the 2300 apart from its competitors, who followed the American style of luxury cars.

Advanced, it had a 2.3 engine with dual valve control, disc brakes on all four wheels (unprecedented in a national car) and a large 100-liter fuel tank.

Due to the good mechanical solutions, the power was 140 hp and the torque was 21.1 kgfm or 206.92 Nm (gross). The brand advertised acceleration from 0 - 100 km/h or 0 - 62 mph in 11.7 seconds and a top speed of 170 km/h 105,633 mph.

Inside, there was a mix of luxury and sportiness typical of the Italian brand: imitation wood steering wheel, full instrument panel, individual seats and gear shift lever on the floor (this was still unusual in luxury cars of the time, that followed the American style and had the gear shift on the steering column).

In the luxury segment, the main competitors were the Chevrolet Opala 4.1 straight-six, Dodge Charger 5.2 V8 and Ford Galaxie/Landau 5.0 V8, all of them larger and more powerful. However, the 2300 was lighter, which made it perform better than its rivals.

With the ban on imports in 1976, the Alfa Romeo - which the brand sold as the only ""imported"" national car - underwent a series of changes in 1977. Launched as the 2300 B, it had better-looking interior trim, built-in external door handles and improvements to the suspension and engine (better adapted to regular gasoline).

In the following months, another novelty would arrive: the 2300 Ti, with more refined trim, two headrests and three-point seat belts in the back seat, a more complete dashboard and a quadruple carburetor engine that increased power to 149 hp and torque to 23.3 kgfm. However, in early 1978, Alfa Romeo began offering the same version for export on the domestic market, which had a higher compression ratio (more suited to blue gasoline) with 163 hp and 24.4 kgfm or 228.49 Nm.of torque.

That year, Alfa Romeo was acquired by the Fiat Group. From then on, the 2300 stopped being produced in Rio de Janeiro and began to be made in Betim / MG, with better build quality thanks to Fiat's more modern production line.

In 1980, it received a slight restyling with new bumpers and external details, and progressive power steering became a standard item. A few months later, the ethanol version came out with 145 hp and 23 kgfm or 225.55 Nm of torque, called the Ti, with the previous gasoline Ti being renamed Ti4.

At that time, the 2300 was still the most expensive domestic car, surpassing all its competitors. The top-of-the-line Ti4 version became the only one available from 1983 onwards, indicating that the end of the model was near.

In the 1985 line, it received another restyling, in a clear attempt to keep it on the market. The 2300 now had wraparound bumpers, a new front grille and larger tail lights.

Given the low sales volume, Fiat stopped producing the 2300 and closed the Alfa Romeo brand in the country at the end of 1986. Another classic of the national industry, in addition to being one of the best cars produced at the time, the 2300 was innovative in many aspects and a legitimate representative of the luxury segment without giving up sportiness. Its features pleased those who enjoyed the ""European"" driving style.",OriginalPapaya8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fgn6tm,/r/WeirdWheels/comments/1fgn6tm/the_alfaromeo_2300_aka_alfaromeo_rio_an_alfaromeo/,4,2024-09-14 14:22:22,10,,False,1.0,Obscure,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

> Despite these efforts, the mass opposition protests of 2011-2012, followed by the widespread youth support for Putin&#039;s foe Alexei Navalny up until his death this February, proved that the regime had failed to win over the younger generation.

> The full-scale invasion of Ukraine two and a half years ago renewed the government&#039;s focus on youth indoctrination.

> On Thursday, a draft law titled &quot;On Systematizing the Sphere of Youth Policy&quot; was introduced in the State Duma, Russia&#039;s lower house of parliament.

> In May 2022, just three months after the war began, Putin launched the &quot;Movement of the Firsts,&quot; modeled on the Soviet Pioneers.

> The Kremlin is now transforming Rosmolodyozh, the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs, into a vast new ideological body tasked with systematizing and unifying all youth ideological education initiatives, from kindergarten to higher education.

SwiftlyNeutral,1fgn2fx,"Why are some ""Swifties"" so mad at Taylor because of endorsement when she has been left-leaning (by USA definition) for the most of her career life? ","Non-American 11-year East Asian Swiftie here. Today I came across a Tiktok of a conservative woman who was burning Taylor's albums and book (?) while talking to the camera. There was also another MAGA woman who said she sold her eras tickets and refused to bring her daughter to Taylor's concerts. I legit don't understand these people. Isn't Taylor left-leaning most of her career life? She has voted Dem since 2016 (I saw some people say she also voted for Obama in 2009, but I didn't see the source). She spoke for gun control and advocated for Dem politicians in TN in 2018. She released an entire documentary dissing Trump in 2020. She condemned the overturn of RvW in 2022. How is endorsing Harris surprising to anyone who's a fan?

I have never even suspected that she was those far-right extremists even before she became political. I don't know how do those people who claimed to be ""swifties"" but don't even KNOW these public records BEFORE ??? Like damn then what are you even following if your values are SO different? How do you listen to all too well and shout ""fk the patriarchy""?  How do you listen to ""I need to calm down"" and not support LGBT rights? How do you listen to ""the man"" and think nothing about sexism? What do you think "" we paint the town blue"" mean in ""Miss Americana""? Again I didn't even mention ""only the young"" was used for Biden's campaign during 2020. The songs I mentioned are all in the setlist of the eras tour, and now you claim you don't want to bring your daughter to the concerts because of...what she endorses align with what she sings? Also, can we mention the fact that these women are actively voting against their own and their daughters' interests by voting T?

I noticed that in my country, similar conversations are happening too. Suddenly, there were so many self-claimed ""swifties"" (most are men) on my country's social media say they are disappointed in her & can't believe she supports Dem. Some say she shouldn't involve in politics, but these are the same people who said nothing when Kanye supported T and literally ran for president himself with no shame?

Can anyone help me explain this? The only reason I can come up with is that being associated with American football industry & the hype of eras tour worldwide have brought her a whole new group of conservative-leaning fans. I didn't remember having many of these people I mentioned at the beginning in our fandom when she was still with Joe. I thought Taylor = anti-trump was literally common sense inside the fandom.

TLDR: Can't figure out the anger from self-claimed ""swifties"" who are conservative and planning to vote for T when Taylor has been democrat-leaning for a very long time. They didn't know her public records before they became a fan ???",peggyzyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftlyNeutral/comments/1fgn2fx/why_are_some_swifties_so_mad_at_taylor_because_of/,/r/SwiftlyNeutral/comments/1fgn2fx/why_are_some_swifties_so_mad_at_taylor_because_of/,71,2024-09-14 14:16:35,76,,False,0.86,Swifties,2024-09-14 12:19:04.342710

springfieldMO,1fgpgac,"Missouri Senate Race 2024: Kunce Inches Forward While Hawley Casually Enjoys His Double-Digit Lead, Thanks to Missouri’s “Progressive” Voter Base","[https://mygladstone.com/](https://mygladstone.com/)

As the 2024 Missouri Senate race trudges forward, Democratic hopeful Lucas Kunce has managed to gain some ground on Republican incumbent Josh Hawley. According to the latest poll from GQR, conducted between September 6-12, Kunce has rocketed all the way up to 46%, still four points behind Senator Hawley’s cool 50%. This marks a stunning improvement from earlier polling, where Kunce was trailing by a mere 15 points. So close, right?

Just a week ago, the *Missouri Scout*-sponsored Remington Research Group poll had Hawley ahead by a comfortable 52% to Kunce’s 37%. Apparently, 645 likely voters now believe Kunce might stand a *chance* — maybe. But hey, let’s not forget the YouGov poll from mid-August, where Kunce was still playing catch-up with a stellar 42% compared to Hawley’s solid 53%. The momentum is clearly in Kunce’s favor! Or not.

Yet, Kunce’s campaign has one ace up its sleeve: the hot-button issue of abortion rights. After all, why shouldn’t Democrats pin their hopes on this when running in a deeply conservative state that has repeatedly shown it loves change and forward-thinking policies? Surely, Missouri voters will toss aside decades of entrenched red-state values and rally to Kunce’s banner. How could they resist? After all, it’s not like Hawley has locked in his base by championing those beloved ""traditional values"" or opposing progressive policies. No, definitely not.

The Democrats, in their infinite wisdom, are banking on the abortion rights ballot amendment to magically turn the tide in Missouri. Because when you’re down 15 points one week and only 4 the next, what could go wrong? All Kunce needs to do is hope that Missouri voters — famously open-minded — and projected to turn out and encode abortion right into the state constitution, will decide that this is the year to also flip the state blue. Keep in mind that Kansas also instituted abortion rights last year but that has not made the state any less red. Kansans vote pro-choice while keeping their anti-choice GOP senators. Would Missouri be any different?

But hey, who knows? Maybe Missouri will surprise everyone, and Kunce will ride the wave of progressive enthusiasm all the way to Washington. Or, Hawley will just keep doing what he’s doing, and November 5 will be just another day at the office for him. [https://www.mygladstone.com/2024/09/missouri-senate-race-2024-hawley.html](https://www.mygladstone.com/2024/09/missouri-senate-race-2024-hawley.html)",My_Gladstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/springfieldMO/comments/1fgpgac/missouri_senate_race_2024_kunce_inches_forward/,/r/springfieldMO/comments/1fgpgac/missouri_senate_race_2024_kunce_inches_forward/,1,2024-09-14 16:03:33,5,,False,0.78,Politics,2024-09-14 12:19:05.641513

the_everything_bubble,1fgpfoq,Trump is no longer trying to win the election,"
The word is out.  Trump is no longer trying to win the election.

It’s very obvious now that Trump is not trying to win the election.

Why else would he go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things he did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let’s be honest.  Trump wants to lose.  Why else would he go on a the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

 He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Why else would he go on a debate stage and refuse to support Poland against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine?

He had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Trump knows he’s going to lose but he is using his air time to make a push for another run in the entertainment industry.  Trump will be a consultant in a movie about his political career.

He won’t play himself.  Instead the role of Trump will go to Ric Flair, the ex-professional wrestler known as the “dirtiest wrestler” in the game.

Flair was very popular for his bleached blond hair and carnival barking style.  Thousands of wrestling fans believed his act was real and they adored him much like Trump supporters adore Trump.

Dolly Parton is being courted to star as Stormy Daniels, the American pornographic film actress and former stripper.

Trump’s extras in the movie will be picked in a pecking order with the first opportunities going to the “patriots” who attacked the Capitol.

The secondary roles will go to former MAGAs who were not part of the attack but supported MAGA.

MAGA movie extra hopefuls will have to bring a red MAGA cap to be considered as an extra for the movie: “Trump. He did it his Way.”",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/1fgpfoq/trump_is_no_longer_trying_to_win_the_election/,2,2024-09-14 16:02:47,4,,False,1.0,POLITICS,2024-09-14 12:19:05.641513

I guarantee it. 1000%Think about it -- Putin's hacking our government and trump is the malware. Putin's given him root.But if trump doesn't get reelected that messes Putin [up.So](http://up.So) to take the focus off all the malware stuff Putin has trump doing , like becoming a dictator, Project 2025, and letting Putin run the USA by trump proxy - they feed him distracting resource-wasting talking points, and strategies to keep trump in power!Putin and the KGB distract us from their dictatorship proxy hack by having trump say the stupidest most divisive things possible to keep us focusing on the wrong stuff and fighting amongst ourselves. 2 Days ago how many news stations were focusing on Haitians eating cats??? Way too many!Instead, American media and citizens should be focusing on things like trump having legal immunity in government, trump replacing all the electoral college vote counters with his own people, and the supreme court having been replaced with all trump appointees. trump is basically being set up to be a dictator by Putin -- and that's what Putin DOESN'T want us to focus on.

EndFPTP,1fgp4j6,Are there any (joke?) voting systems using tournament brackets?,"This is not a serious post, but this has been on my mind. I think it's pretty clear that if a voting system used a tournament bracket structure where you start out with (randomly) determined pairs whose loser is eliminated and winner is paired up with the winner from the neighboring pair, and where each match-up's winner is determined with ranked ballot pairwise wins, it would elect the Condorcet winner and be Smith compliant (I am pretty sure). If the brackets are known at the time of voting, strategic voting is going to be possible, and this method would probably fail many criteria. What happens, though, if the bracket is randomly generated after the voting has been completed? In essence this should be similar to Smith/Random ballot, but it doesn't *sound* like it. No one ""ballot"" would be responsible, psychologically, for the result. And because it would be a random ballot, it would also make many criteria inapplicable, because the tipping points are not voter-determined or caused by changes in the ballots, but unknowable and ungameable.

PBB season ngayon. Nadidisappoint ako

1. Nominated Challenges - Simula umpisa until now di binigyan ng pagkakataon mga nominated para iligtas sarili nila. Like yung dating season laging meron challenge na binibigay sa mga nominated kada week, kung saan maglalaban laban ang mga nominated at kung sino mananalo mawawala sila sa Nominated. Kaya nung pumasok si JOSHUA GARCIA sa loob ng bahay tinanong niya kung nasan ang activity area sabi ni Dylan wala, e diba dun lagi yung place kapag may challenges. Dun palang napaisip na ko talaga. Ngayon votings na lang? Parang unfair kasi alam natin madali dayain yun, kapag may challenge nga naman di nila mappredict kung sino mananalo so mahihirapan sila palabasin yung gusto nila palabasin.

2. Lumalabas yung mga Old Pic nila Jarren, Jas, Jp, Brix at Dylan na magkakasama bago pa ang Pbb at take not nakafollow sila sa isat isa. Ibig sabihin magkakakilala na sila dati pa lang. Meron din clip sa Black app na nagkkwentuhan ang mga teens about sa gagawin nila paglabas like gagala sila tapos inaya ni Jp sila Rain and Kai na gumala at isasama niya daw yung mga friends nila ni Jarren from Outside. May rumors din na lisa lang sila ng Management.

3. Sa Rap Battle- uncut yung pinalabas, di nilabas yung buong clip na about sa pagdamay ni Jas sa Mother at education ni Fyang. Tapos dinelete din nila yung teaser ng rap battle nila and akala ko nung friday ipapalabas na nila yung rap battle pero biglang hindi pinalabas like binitin tayong lahat nung Friday. Parang prinoprotektahan talaga nila si Jas.

4 Pansin ko rin yung kapag nagiging nominated si Jas pagdating sa mga bilang ng Votes ang laki lagi ng votes niya which is parang may mali kasi kung titignan mo sa socmed wala akong nakikitang fandom ni Jas. Pano nangyari yun? Pati yung kay Dylan mas nanalo pa siya kesa sa DongPat?

5. Tinanggal yung BBE kasi feeling ko nanalo sa Task ngayong week yung mga teens so automatic nominated lahat ng mga Adults and alam nila na tatadtarin ng taong bayan ng BBE si Jas at pwede ma-evict.

Fantasy,1fgp1nu,A Critique of 'Some Desperate Glory' by Emily Tesh,"[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58388343-some-desperate-glory)

*Now let me get this straight,* 'SDG' is a good book. Kyr's character arc is strong. I enjoy the author's voice. The setting is a clever inversion of tropes to tell a compelling story. I don't want to take away the joy this book gives to it's fans. Even I mostly enjoyed reading it.

If you're the book's author, or a fan who's not in the mood for critique, quit reading now.

Let's start with a quotation.

>

>

This is the second time I'm trying to read 'Some Desperate Glory;' I tried once prior and DNFed it. After 'SDG' won the Hugo, I decided to pick it back up again.

My taste and Hugo taste has diverged over the years. I'm a dude, and I'm aware of my biases. I can get over myself enough to read and enjoy these books, but my biases still exist. I'm in a rather frustrating place of liking fantasy books which are both 'literary' and also 'male-coded.' These days I have trouble finding books because so much of what is considered 'literary' in the genre is female-coded. (I know, I know, I'm using gender essentialist language.)

Many of the books which are nominated for the Hugo (and similar awards) have a shared 'Hugo-bait' mouthfeel: Sapphic (but not *too* Sapphic), progressive and introspective about real world issues (but not progressive/introspective enough to upset a center-left reader). The prose has a modern voice. Optionally add some 'cozy/twee' or 'found family,' and you have a recipe for award consideration.

It feels like there is social stagnation surrounding the Hugo awards, and to a lesser extent the SciFi/Fantasy genre as a whole. In the above quote, Terry Pratchett said that J.R.R. Tolkien was so influential that the Fantasy genre stagnated around him. Tolkien's old news; these days, I feel as though queer/progressive/introspective have become the new Mt. Fuji for the genre awards. A book doesn't need to have every part of the Fuji formula to earn award nominations, but most have one or two.

'Some Desperate Glory' stands at the apex of Mt. Fuji. 'SDG' is a perfectly acceptable example of the sort of trendy book which gets popular these days in the more literary side of the mainstream SciFi/Fantasy genre: a bit queer (but not so queer as to upset wishy-washy moderates), discusses an interesting real-world topic (deprogramming yourself from a cult), and a bit progressive (a socially conservative protagonist learns the error of her ways).

'SDG' challenges an unhealthy status quo, but doesn't challenge the status quo enough to upset a center-left reader.

To explain one aspect of what I mean, an example. This book is about a death cult, and the book ends with Kyr collectively deprogramming the entire cult in under twelve minutes. *That would not happen in the real world. People drink the Kool-Aid in these situations*. *A chunk of people would have stayed on the space station when it blew up.* When the author deliberately ends the book on the note of 'all lives should be saved,' I read that as an emotional appeal to a center-left audience, reinforcing their worldview. That is a strong writing mechanism for emotional investment.

And it's fine that it isn't a challenging book. I'm against all books being 'realistic.' It's important for books like 'SDG' to exist to remind us what we believe and why we believe it. As a work of social justice art, 'SDG' more than earns it's keep.

Taking a look at the bigger picture, I feel that what is considered 'critically praiseworthy art' for the genre is increasingly hemmed in by the Mt. Fuji of queer/progressive/introspection; 'critically praiseworthy art' in scifi/fantasy is hypertargetted to a center-left audience. It's mildly frustrating for me to see how thoroughly gatekept pretty much every award in the genre is. Things are so gatekept, I doubt that were 'Lord of the Rings' published today it would win *anything*. 'LotR' has a pro-monarchic message with an all-male cast; it's out of touch with today's voters*.* I doubt 'LotR' would even receive grassroots popularity among the greater reading community were it published today.

In many ways, I think the genre is healthier than it's ever been. Women and people of color can become lauded as once-in-a-generation talents. We're rediscovering luminaries like Octavia Butler. Protagonists are allowed to be women now, be any ethnicity, religion. We have new settings like Africa and Asia and Mesoamerica instead of trite old Europe again and again.

And the use of scifi/fantasy as a method for progressive social commentary has always been there. Go back to 'War of the Worlds' being a commentary on British colonialism, or Ursula K. LeGuin's entire oeuvre.

But at the same time, our horizons are shrinking. If you write a book with center-right politics*,* or a staid book like a Quest Fantasy which actively eschews modern political themes, you'll face an uphill battle getting literary plaudits even if your book is objectively among the best of the year.

I don't want to say 'Modern books succeeding is coming at the cost of traditional books failing.' Tastes change over time, and people buy what they want to read. Women read more as a hobby than men; supply and demand means on average progressive/feminist books get published and win awards. But just because capitalist forces cause us to take an 'out with the old' attitude with our artwork, doesn't mean I have to like that the cultures wars have been brought home 100% of the time.

The Puppies were wrong (racism is bad), but the nominees for the Hugo have gotten homogenous over the last decade. There was a streak of several years (2020, 2021) when no men were even nominated for Best Novel. 'Some Desperate Glory' is a good book in a vacuum, but inarguably feels a bit homogenous when I compare it to a good chunk of other Hugo-nominated stuff I've read.

I don't want to badmouth this year's Hugo conference, not after the clusterf\_\_\_ which was last year's. And credit where due, it appears that the worst of the homogeneity is over; for the last two years dudes actually made the ballot, which is an improvement. Here's hoping things continue to improve.

Spoilers Below. I'm writing this review in good faith, as one author reviewing another's book, trying to balance positives with negatives.

Before we begin, do you have a book which needs editing? Do you want to read more reviews? Here is a link: [The Rest of My In Depth Reviews](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2021/05/13/my-in-depth-reviews-analysis/)

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? WHAT GENRES? WHAT MAJOR TROPES?**

* The book is advertised as being for adults, but I think it's YA appropriate. Anyone 16+ can read it. It's a bit mature for 16 year olds, but young people are smart.
* Feminist Space Opera
* Time Loop/Alternate Reality fiction
* Progressive Fiction
* Military Science Fiction
* Star Trek, told from the perspective of the Khan's cult of eugenic supersoldiers

**LETS GET STARTED**

'Some Desperate Glory's' message is heartfelt and it's story well-written. It was written earnestly to please an audience, and I'm given to understand it's target audience enjoyed the book. It is clear the author *cared*. I respect the author's passion. If I were a teacher grading this, I'd give it a solid (B) grade.

I felt complex emotions while reading this. I'm burned out on this exact sort of Hugo-bait books. I take a lot to be impressed these days, and I've seen this formula done better before. It's not a bad book, I enjoyed the middle-half, but I'm jaded. Having such a 'the worlds best fascist girl scout' for a protagonist for the first half of the book didn't work for me; I don't object to unlikeable protagonists, but she was so one note about 'yay fascism' that I got bored.

I don't want to badmouth this book. I like the concept. It's a neat setting where humans are the villains fighting a Star Trek Federation/Mass Effect Citadel civilization in a galactic guerilla war. The Federation/Citadel has a godlike AI which is capable of controlling space and time; defeating the AI requires nonlinear thinking by the rebels in such a way which is a great read. That's a neat concept, and it's executed pretty well. I wish it leaned more into a 'free will vs determinism' angle, but it didn't.

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

And this is when things get weird. This book foreshadows being a 'Handmaid's Tale' sort of thing, and swerves into being a timeloop/'Groundhog's Day'/butterfly effect sort of thing. The book foreshadows feminist issues being of extreme plot importance, in the form of forced impregnation, and then does nothing with it. Truth told, I was very *meh* about the first half, when the book was all fascist, and only got interested halfway through when the author took the novel in another direction.

I have mixed feelings over this structure.

On one hand, I enjoyed the 'Groundhog's Day' twist. It was a neat way to explore a character deconstructing their worldview, realizing that her worldview was built on lies all along. That was my favorite part of the book. While the time loop weirdness was going on, I was thinking to myself, ""Oh, I see why people like this."" I enjoyed the time travel so much I think it should have started earlier, perhaps as early as the Inciting Incident (aka give or take halfway through the first act of the book).

On the other hand, having the 'Handmaid's Tale' vibe being so heavily featured and then not actually explored feels like a bait-and-switch. I wanted a discussion of motherhood, forced impregnation, assault and the patriarchy, but we didn't get it. It feels like the book failed to commit to it's premise.

The theme of 'motherhood' could have carried through the time travel section; we easily could have gotten a chapter or two where Kyr's in an alternate universe where she's in Nursery working as a parent and teacher. And she's *happy* working in Nursery, instead of hardcore disgusted like she is in the main timeline. In retrospect, I'm shocked the book didn't have that chapter; it would have been a fantastic opportunity for character growth for Kyr, helping her unpack her internalized misogyny and thus deconstruct her religion. (I know she's a lesbian, but queers can find parenthood wholesome too.)

Overall, I think this book needed more work in the developmental stages. All the component parts for a good book are here. A good draft or two could have tightened up the plot and clarified the theme. I understand why the Hugo voters voted for it; if you squint and forgive a little sloppiness, you can see the story the author was trying to tell.

As for pacing, I did *not* like the first half of the book. It felt *slooow*. I was struggling to even pick up the book due to boredom. The second half of the book picked up the pace, but I feel like the book needed more time loops because they were thematically at the core of the book. Maybe the book could start mid-time travel, then double back to the beginning? Told the story non-linearly?

I listened to the audiobook, and it was 16 hours long. This easily could have been 10 to 14 hours.

**EVERYTHING ELSE**

Earth was destroyed, leaving mankind without a homeworld. In the ruins, mankind came together and founded Gaea station. In the hallowed halls of Gaea, a profound oath was sworn: vengeance for the billions of dead. No price is too high to avenge dead Earth.

Kyr was born and raised into the religion of Gaea station. She believes profoundly that humans are real people and nonhuman sentient aliens are not real people. She trained from a young age to become a peerless fighter... but when the time comes, she's assigned to become a professional mother. Gaea station is an artificial ecosystem, and human life is only sustained through deliberate planning and hard work... including having children. In the highly patriarchal society of Gaea, this 'women's work' is considered dishonorable. Proud Kyr is humbled.

I feel like the culture of Gaea is mostly well done. The death of several billion people hangs over this story like a lead weight. Kyr's radical beliefs make sense in light of those deaths. Kyr *literally* doesn't view herself as a person with her own agency; she views herself in the context of the dead who need vengeance. She ultimately becomes detached from her religion (aka the burden of Earth) when she interacts with an alien and realizes they're people too.

I liked the concept behind Gaea's society, but on reflection I think it is a bit ridiculous. In real life, even in highly patriarchal societies, women have power. For example, women often form whisper-networks to discuss issues and solve problems quietly behind men's backs, or to quietly isolate problematic men. If such a whisper-network existed in Gaea, why was Kyr excluded? Likewise, if human life is so valuable, why do they treat soldiers and mothers as disposable? Further, why can't all these highly trained warrior women use the threat of violence to crush the patriarchal system and make it more egalitarian?

There are worldbuilding plotholes here you can drive a tank through. Most, if not all of these plotholes can be explained away with a bit of critical thinking. What appears as plot holes are really just a believably malfunctioning society after it has been put under great stress.

To quote a [goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5097247845):

>

Again, that can be explained away. The dictatorship killed anyone capable of independent thought, including the doctors, because they could foment rebellion against the regime. Because the gynecologists are dead, bad stuff happens. This would have been a good worldbuilding detail if the author mentioned it, but the author didn't mention it, so I'm jumping to conclusions here.

Another plot hole is that the time-travel plot depends upon a god-ai being easily hijacked by two enemy soldiers on a roadtrip. I am incredulous how *useless* the Majoda are, not having a working military after winning a major war against humanity, when they know *humanity is still out there*.[ So much of this plot depends on people behaving stupidly, including a hyperintelligent god-ai which should be able to send messages back in time to prevent itself from being hijacked in the first place.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) (Speaking of which, how can the server architecture of Wisdom be so poorly designed that a single bad actor is able to extinguish life on hundreds of thousands of planets? Do the Majoda not have white-hat hackers to stress-test this system?)

After a point I get exasperated that I have to forgive so many plot holes. I don't generally like addressing plot holes in my critiques because they're usually lazy criticism. In this case, there were enough plot holes to harm my immersion. This isn't trying to be Hard SF, but I think it's reasonable to expect an author to think through the second-order consequences of the scifi ideas they're playing around with.

In short, 'SDG' failed the 'verisimilitude' test. Some stories don't even try to pass the verisimilitude test; 'The Princess Bride' is a beloved book and movie which fails the verisimilitude test *hard*, and that failure was the author/director's goal all along. However, I think that 'SDG' was trying to pass the verisimilitude test.

The setting and plot feels like the thinly veiled mouthpiece for the author because of that lack of verisimilitude. **Time travel books are hard to write,** and this book didn't manage it. This feels like the author was trying to say 'don't think too hard about it.'

And finally the 'fascism' issue. The protag is growing up in a eugenicist doomsday cult sworn to avenge the deaths of several billion people, fighting a guerilla war in which there's no hope for success. You know how there used to be Japanese soldiers on random Asian islands left behind after WW2, who were still fighting the war decades after Japan surrendered? Gaea station had the vibe of those Japanese soldiers.

And then the plot of the story resolves with Kyr just... giving up. She realized there was no hope for Gaea to ever win, she's alienated by her terrible superior officers, and switches sides. Most Western books are about a Chosen One going on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge and achieving some justified catharsis. This book foreshadowed that catharsis (revenge for billions of people!) but had a twist ending of realizing the war's over, stop fighting, surrender and emotionally heal. That was a surprisingly fresh take. It will be a problematic ending for people on the far right and the far left, but it was good for me. A+ for the ending thematic, even if the whole book is about a B for me.

One last thing. For Military SF, I expect good fightscenes. The fights in this were quick to the point of being dull. I'm disappointed.

Overall, the book is good. I feel like I'm trying to argue myself out of having enjoyed it. I wouldn't have given it 'Best Novel,' but I feel like it was worth reading.

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

The audiobook was pretty good.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

As an author, I want to improve my own writing/editing skills. To that end, I like to learn lessons from every story I read. Here's what I learned from this story:

* The verisimilitude test.
   * A book which has too many plotholes or goofy bits of worldbuilding might suffer under the weight of expectations, and cause unintended problems in the rest of the novel.
   * Not all stories have to pass the verisimilitude test ('The Princess Bride' does not, as an example), but it's something to consider when revising your novel.

[Here's a link to all the lessons I've previously learned.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2022/05/06/lessons-learned/)

**SUMMARY**

I enjoyed the book in a 'brain off, happy vibes' sort of way. But after I put this book under the microscope, I kept discovering wonky things about it. The more I think about this book, the more it falls apart upon examination.

In the context of me being an objective critic, this book is good. Not amazing, but worth reading. It tackles an important topic with some amount of delicacy, which is good.

In the context of my personal taste disliking Hugo-bait books, and this being Hugo-bait... it's fine. I won't read it again, but I don't think I wasted my time reading it. But if you're like me and don't like this sort of book, it's safe to avoid.

For me he wasn't impressive in Roadies, didn't like him in Splits, in fact I hated their gang and only liked Nikhil. (Personally I felt like he was a better performer and hated the way his gang only treated him like a vote bank)

He was a total bully in Ace Of Space. I still remember him tearing Pratik's clothes and Danish Zehen hiding them from him despite being on the opposite because he knew Pratik didn't have many clothes (God bless his soul). And the faces his family made on the finale when Varun didn't get in the top two. His sister came out saying there's no way Pratik could get more votes than him

I know he got a lot of the love after the tragic breakup. It was sad I understand the sympathizing but nothing more. I absolutely despise Divya but after the breakup she did make a lot of statements that Varun never denied or defended like how she'd come from work and Varun would just be on the couch playing videogames all day or how he wasn't there for her as much as needed when her dad passed away.

**Everything Starts with a Tutorial**

  
Development Diary I: From Jam to Steam - Everything Starts with the Tutorial  
The Shadowed Rune was born as a Jam game, created in 2 weeks. After receiving positive feedback in the voting, I decided to prepare a new version, researching lighting and gathering feedback on what worked and what didn't.  
  
The main feedback was the significant difference in mechanics between the tutorial and the ""dungeon."" I created a very detailed room to teach you the main mechanics. But the next room was a huge level full of enemies, pots to break, and runes to collect. The problem was that it quickly became repetitive, the level was enormous, and it was easy to get lost and find the way to the Boss from the Jam version. I took all this into account in the GDD for the next version.  
  
The 1st decision was to redo the tutorial after creating a solid foundation. Using the Jam base, I rewrote and optimized all the code to prepare it for a larger game without any poorly programmed elements that could limit it. The tutorial was crucial in this game since it has more complex combat mechanics than other games, especially being a family-friendly game that you could play with your child or partner. I wanted to respect the story I was creating but also avoid constant system messages that stopped the action (it was also a hassle to press text 10 times every time I tested something). The solution I found was to create pop-up texts when approaching certain places in each room.  


[This little character helps you with some tips](https://i.redd.it/camjghxulsod1.gif)

This tiny character was already planned to appear later in the tower as a being who likes mana crystals and trades them for other items. It was the perfect opportunity to help explain basic functions like ""push/dodge,"" rotating runes, or deleting them. Additionally, it would also give hints if someone got stuck.  
  
The 2nd decision was to make the game cooperative from the start. It would be local co-op with an online option via Steam's Remote Play Together. Once I rewrote the control of the first character from scratch to add some improvements, creating a second player was easy, but making everything fit was another story... the game is designed to be played with keyboard and mouse and gamepads, but each player needed to choose their character, have their own key mapping, and this had to be shown in the game. Imagine the mess, especially using Game Maker where nothing is pre-made, and you do everything from scratch... For example, one of the features I had to discard almost immediately was the camera zooming out, because if players separated too much one of other, the lighting system caused a significant drop in performance. It was a shame because it was a very useful effect without resorting to a split screen.  
  
When you control a single player, you have two camera options. If you move the mouse/right stick, you can look in that direction like in 'Nuclear Throne'. But if you don't touch the stick or mouse, the camera centers on the player, and you can play like classic 2D Zelda, even if you don't need to fight, you can control everything with just the keyboard...

ff  
  
In co-op mode, the camera works more simply, centering on a point between the two players and always staying centered. This limits the players' movement (they can't go off-screen or separate much), but in boss fights, it gives a lot of freedom, usually keeping the boss in the center of the room with enough visibility to dodge and attack, just like when there are many enemies.  
  
The main challenge in the last month has been coordinating everything so that the game and story work whether you play solo or co-op. It didn't seem right to start playing in co-op and then tell the second player, ""Hey, you have to wait 5 minutes to play."" So, when you start playing, we take the opportunity to introduce the second character, Brishen, and how he finds his artifact. In single-player mode, you find Brishen later with his rune artifact already equipped.  
  
The 3rd decision I made after receiving feedback and considering the co-op mode, lighting performance, and the game's concept was to reduce the size of the dungeons. The two levels that make up the current tutorial are proof of this, as they are small, detailed levels.

[First view of the tutorial area](https://preview.redd.it/dc1xxrw1msod1.jpg?width=929&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85fad205fb4c5c300f75575661c7bc8181df97cf)

  
Additionally, not having huge levels helps ensure players don't separate too much or feel the need to. It also allows me to create more detailed levels with puzzles, combats, and treasures. Smaller but with more quality and even better performance.  
  
What I'm planning are levels with between 4 and 8 rooms at most, each with different challenges to overcome. The challenge now is coordinating the creation of hand-made rooms with random elements and then placing those rooms in a dungeon connected randomly but logically. I've already done some tests, and the results are promising... but I'll talk about that in the next development diary. Thanks for reading!

WorldSeedSystem,1fgonco,Figuring out my next job,"I put the continuation of my current project up to a vote. if 100 people say I should continue my project - I will. The program is usable in its current form, download link in SubReddit description.   
In the meantime, I will figure out what other project I would really like to do and get started on that.  
There has not been much in the way of support for this project thus far, and I am concerned that continuing it will just drain my time and resources for no purpose. 

I might build a racing game - I tried to do something like assassins creed - but that is where I started World Seed. there was a reason - Animation Retargeting was failing bad, so I tried to make my own rig setup - I did succeed, but it took weeks of work - and I forgot about making inverse kinematics, and then I realized I would need to run this on something other than the CPU - so I wound up having to quit that.  
I tried to build a vehicle building game where you drive around a vehicle made of parts - I got bored of that when I realized the floating point limitation prevented parts smaller than a certain size - that broke my system. So I had to put that on hold too.

to be honest I have not had many successes - though did learn a great many things along the way.  
The best thing I had built was a racing game, if I can combine a track editor and terrain editor I can make  the race course I want - then I just need to work on vehicles.  I know how to use blender 3D Modeller, I am just not very good at it. So if anyone wants to help be build  a racing game - they are free to help out and I can figure out how to pay you based on a group input - IE, we work out a plan. I need to get paid before I can pay others - IE, the game needs to make revenue, revenue is gathered via a few means. KickStarter, Patreon, and Paypal are the means of payment. each with its own drawbacks. I have no clue what those are. KickStarter is a donations platform, and might not be available in Canada. Patreon has taxes levied on it - I will need to pay appropriate taxes. and Paypal is paypal. I can get money transfers from people, or send to people on a one  time basis. No clue if I have an account.

sanepolitics,1enaz0m,The contrast between two individuals and their interviews couldn't be greater: ,"And at least the one thing that can be said here is that Biden continues to do what he's been doing all along. Focusing on Trump, the threat that man poses to our democracy no matter what happens, and keeping the American people aware of it in spite of a media complimenting the hangman on the quality of the noose he ties on the gallows he's preparing for them. Biden's priorities are and have been the right ones and the right enemy at the right time in the right place. 

And so are those of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. 

Meanwhile Trump goes on interviews and openly promises that Christians will never vote again because he'll make them have an Iran for Jesus and they'll clearly unite around the same vision (which the entire history of Christianity prior to the Enlightenment and in parts of the world where that never happened shows is horseshit) and speaks incoherent Engrish and people just love the guy who can't string two coherent sentences together across two weeks.

imaginaryelections,1fefazf,City of the World's Desire | 1938 and 2020 elections in a world where Paraguay did not become independent and Rafael Franco was a populist dictator instead of Perón ,"Lieutenant General Rafael Franco governed according to authoritarian nationalist and populist principles, basing himself on Benito Mussolini and Ivan Ilyin. 

While Franco initially suspended the 1855 constitution, viewing it as out of touch with changes in the country, he later scheduled elections to a National Constituent Assembly to May 1937; they were won by the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR), a party supportive of social reform and workers' rights and ideologically based around the principles of the February Revolution¹. 

The 1937 Constitution² codified the workers' rights legislation Franco had signed in 1936–37 into Argentine law, allowed the government to permanently intervene in the economy, made the president and vice president directly elected³, and removed term limits for the presidency. However, while Argentine territory stretched from the Gran Chaco in the north to the Islas Malvinas to the south, territories remained excluded from presidential elections. 

The following year, Franco, who ran a campaign taking advantage of his charisma and populist rethoric and making widespread use of sound trucks and radio, was elected to a full term. He was reelected in 1942, 1946, 1950 and 1954 before being overthrown by the military⁴.

In 2012, Fernando Lugo of the Frente Pátria Grande was elected President of Argentina, defeating Ricardo Alfonsin of the Radical Civic Union. 

Lugo led Argentina throughout the 2010s, shifting the country's politics to the left by overturning the privatisation of strategic companies and expanding welfare programs. He, however, was socially conservative as a former Catholic priest, and sought closer relations with India, France and China. 

In 2016, Lugo was reelected over Macri⁵, with his second term seeing the continuation of previous policies, but he grew increasingly unpopular with Argentine voters after 2018; by November 2020, the President's approval rating was 43%. As such, the opposition was heavily favoured to win the presidential elections. 

Milei's strong showing, with 16% of the vote, shocked pundits, who did not expect him to do this well. His base was among rural voters who wanted a radical departure from leftism, but this was not enough, and the libertarian politician failed to make inroads with people in major cities.

The last place finish of the incumbent party's candidate was also seen as an upset, and was attributed to tactical voting from the long-entrenched PRF, as well as Lugo's low approval ratings, which meant only hardcore supporters from northern Argentina⁶ voted for Grabois. Macri's promise of a return to economic liberalism, at least in the short term, appealed to the middle class and businesspeople, who opposed the social democratic and protectionist policies of the administration.  

The Islas Malvinas voted for Macri; the federal territory comprised of the Malvinas, South Georgia Island, and Argentine Antarctica supported him on both rounds. 

Early during the second round campaign, Massa was expected to win in the second round, but Macri was eventually elected, becoming the first conservative Argentine president since Menem during the 1990s.

imaginaryelections,1fcwo7r,City of the World's Desire | latest elections in two fictional countries ,"Muscat is considered by NGOs such as Freedom House to be an authoritarian regime.

High commodity prices during the 2000s allowed the authoritarian capitalist¹ Teixeira Filho regime to mask its repression by sponsoring sports competitions such as Formula 1, and participating in extensive lobbying efforts across Europe. He also tried to help the United States during the war on terror by making Muscati ports and airbases available to CENTCOM, and supporting the invasion of Somalia in March 2003². 

Teixeira Filho first showed signs of authoritarianism in 2011, when he amended the constitution to allow him to run for an unlimited number of terms. The following year, he was reelected with 80% of the vote, carrying every state, and began using counterterrorism laws dating back to the 1990s civil war³ to try and imprison political opponents, including PIM leaders, on trumped up charges. 

During the early-to-mid 2010s, the United States administration of Mitt Romney supported the government of Muscat, viewing it as a moderate force in the region and bulwark against terrorism. However, President Justin Trudeau, who took office in 2017, began to scrutinize Muscat's human rights effort, drawing Teixeira Filho closer to Iran, China, and India instead of the US. In 2018, he was reelected in elections described as having widespread fraud. 

However, Muscat's extensive oil reserves have made it one of the most developed countries in the Middle East and globally. It has a 96% literacy rate, more citizens with university degrees per capita than any other Middle Eastern country, and an average life expectancy of 80 years. It's also an easy country to do business in, with little regulation of economic activity beyond working conditions and financial speculation.

Between 1994 and 2024, Nyasaland politics⁴ were dominated by the FLN and NE (New Hope). 

Nelson Chamisa's election, achieved by running as an anti-corruption outsider and economic developmentalist, ended this, and destroyed the MDP, which, in 2012, renamed itself to Nova Esperança in order to fit the new times. 

Chamisa did very well in the region south of Zambezi, as well as in western Nyasaland, but he fared poorly in the west of the country, which is the FLN's stronghold and birthplace of one its founders, Vasco⁵ Banda. 

Chamber of Deputies results⁶ were as follows:

- CCM: 242 seats
- FLN: 150 seats
- New Hope: 58 seats
- PDP: 42 seats
- PSD: 25 seats 

Chamisa took office on 1 September 2024, with high expectations for his tenure. Many voters, especially the poor who supported his candidacy, see him as Nyasaland's only hope.

10. Donald Tusk (2006–2014)
11. Barbara Nowacka (2014–2022)
12. Tadeusz Morawiecki (2022–)

In 1982, the National Democracy Party, which had ruled Poland as a conservative dictatorship since the ultranationalist Russian ""liberation"" in 1945, lost a general election to the Solidarity Party led by Lech Walesa. Walesa implemented democratic reforms that turned Poland into a liberal democracy with wider civil and political rights, while privatizing most of its social democratic economy. 

By 1990, Walesa had become unpopular, leading to the Socialist Party winning the parliamentary elections against his party. The PPS administrations have pursued social democratic and pro-European policies within the framework of a capitalist economy and democratic government. 

The centrist Civic Platform party of Donald Tusk eventually won the 2006 parliamentary elections, defeating the PPS and the right-wing PiS. Tusk oversaw further European integration and economic reforms, but the Socialists eventually returned to power under Nowacka, who shifted Polish politics to the left on social issues, legalizing abortion and same-sex civil unions.

But then COVID-19 arrived. The Lewica government pursued a moderate, pragmatic policy to deal with the pandemic and its effects, but failed to improve the economy after COVID was over, leading to an opposition victory in the 2022 general election, when PiS ran on  social market economy rethoric and an overall centre-right platform, especially after being forced to form a coalition government with over centrist parties.

As Geraldo Alckmin, the PSDB president of Brazil since 2015¹, was constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, he endorsed Minister of Planning Simone Tebet to succeed him. 

Tebet was the nominee of the ""Avante Brasil"" coalition, composed of MDB, PSDB, Cidadania, PSD, PP, PSB, PODE, DEM, Republicanos, PSL and Avante. She promised the continuation of Alckmin's liberal economic policies. 

Haddad, on the other hand, ran for the Frente Brasil Popular, a coalition made up of PT, PCB and PSTU. He called for the overturn of privatization for the most part, and an end to the dollarization of Petrobrás which has been in effect since the 1990s. 

Ciro Gomes's coalition was named Brasil Soberano and made up of the PDT, Solidariedade, PMN and PCdoB. He campaigned on a Keynesian economic platform based around his development plan, but massively underperformed his polling, finishing third and failing to win any state other than his own. During the second round, Gomes refused to endorse either candidate, but the PDT endorsed Haddad, contributing to his near-victory. 

Tebet has grown increasingly unpopular since taking office, with some opponents even calling for her to get impeached. As of August 2024, 28% of Brazilians consider Tebet's performance as president to be great or good, and the local elections in October are expected to benefit PT and PDT. 

Duplessis's election caused a political realignment in Quebec, making his right-wing coalition dominant in the state and destroying the split that had existed along ethnic lines. 

Before 1936, Quebecois elections were split culturally and religious, with Catholics supporting the Democratic Party and WASPs backing the Republican Party. Consequently, this made the former dominant, with the original Quebec GOP disbanding in 1962. 

Duplessis was reelected in 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952 and 1956, subsequently dying in office in 1959. He was frequently in conflict with the federal government, particularly under Democratic administrations. 

As of 2024, the Republican Party of Quebec is actually named Parti Republicain Quebecois, and mostly made up of conservative Catholics, as it was Duplessis's party, which later rebranded itself in 1974 in order to identify with its counterpart in the rest of the country and distance itself from its authoritarian founder.

Cascadia is the third largest US state, behind Alaska and Nunavut. Its most populous cities are Seattle and Vancouver. 

Trudeau carried Cascadia due to the Democratic tilt and demographic size of its two largest cities, Trudeau and Seattle. 

The only states north of the great lakes Trudeau carried were Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, New Brunswick¹, and Nova Scotia² 

Trudeau held onto Minnesota, which borders Ontario, albeit by a narrow margin – the narrowest of any state he carried during the election. He also made gains with Hispanics compared to 2016, due to capitalizing on Palin's opposition to open borders and illegal immigration. 

After RBG died, Trudeau named Merrick Garland to replace him, who was confirmed by the Senate in January 2021 and has served ever since.

Trudeau lost reelection due to what was interpreted as his overly restrictive COVID policy. The pandemic began in January 2020 in China, and quickly spread worldwide. Palin opposed any restrictions at the federal level while being in favour of allowing state and local governments to enact them, while Trudeau openly encouraged citizens to wear masks and take other steps to stop the spread. This didn't prevent the federal response from being unpopular with American citizens and result in Trudeau losing reelection, as Palin got the anti-lockdown vote out. 

As of 2024, Palin and Putnam are expected to win reelection due to the economic recovery during her administration, as well as the tough approach to China, Cuba, Venezuela and India that has characterized her foreign policy.

On 5 September 2024, a vote of no confidence in the Italian Senate removed Bersani from office 186 to 10, with 4 senators abstaining. He has been replaced by Matteo Renzi pending new elections by the end of the year or mid-2025. 

From the decommunization of Italy in 1991 to the 2015 general election, Italian politics were dominated by the social democratic PS³, and neoliberal PRI⁴, with the democratic socialist PDS and regionalist Lega sometimes serving as kingmakers.

In 2015, a massive corruption scandal in the administration of PRI prime minister Mario Monti led to the PS, which had previously held the premiership from 2000 to 2012, returning to power in a landslide. The scandal, the likes of which had brought the first post-communist government down in 2000, permanently destroyed the PRI as a major political force; in 2018, it had to rebrand itself as ""Us Moderates"" in an attempt to compete with Salvini's party, founded when he split from the centrist Lega the previous year.

COVID, and the way Bersani's administration reacted to it, led to the PS nearly losing its majority in the chamber of deputies, and actually losing theirs in the Senate. Voters without a college education in Padania agreed with Salvini's rethoric painting the Socialist leadership as out of touch technocrats, as shown by his party sweeping rural areas and winning many midsized towns.

On the other hand, Us with Salvini failed to make a strong showing in mainland southern Italy, as the Fdl had greater appeal there, and the historical PCI and successor parties were popular for ending the Mafia and the other improvements brought by communist rule.

Current polling for the next Italian general election shows the centre-right coalition of Us with Salvini, Brothers of Italy and Lega Nord winning and forming a government, with the Sinestra Italia, which broke with the PSI, finishing a surprisingly strong third.

After Germany lost its world empire and monarchies⁵, and suffered two nuclear attacks by the United States, it experienced rapid economic growth and recovery, aided by United States investment geared against communist France. 

In 1951, a watershed event in Germany's political history happened, when the pre-WWII Free Conservatives and German People's Party merged with the Centre Party, forming a center-right party supported both by Catholics and Protestants; it also formed a permanent coalition with the Christian People's Party⁶ in Bavaria. Four years later, in 1955, the Communist Party of Germany was banned by the Constitutional Court in response to its strong election showing the previous year, but, in 1974, Prime Minister Herbert Karl Frahm resigned after Gunter Guillaume, one of his closest aides, was exposed as an agent of the SDECE. 

Angela Merkel was Germany's longest-serving prime minister since Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century. She governed as a center-right Christian democrat, but faced backlash from the right due to her pro-immigration views. In 2022, Merkel chose to step down to allow for new leadership. 

The SPD had shifted to a centre-left platform under the joint leadership of Saskia Esken and Herbert Walter-Borjans. They began opposing neoliberalism and advocating a return to the social market economy implemented by the postwar governments. This platform was considerably popular with the electorate, especially students and the urban working class, but faced opposition from businesspeople and farmers, who feared it would harm their livelihoods. 

Party fatigue and an uncharismatic leader all weighed against the Zentrum throughout the 2022 campaign, resulting in a catastrophically poor showing for the Union. The right-wing to far-right AfD also made minor gains with rural protestants without higher education, while the WASG, previously the main hard left party in Germany, got wiped out of Parliament by the SPD's leftward tilt.

imaginaryelections,1famdmx,Camelot's Revival - Part 2: Slow and Steady,"(Picture 1) As 2001 continue to chug along, speculation around a Kennedy for President run in 2004 continued to grow and grow. As more Democratic politicians privately pressured JFK Jr. to give it at least some level of consideration. As the year went on, magazines such as Time, the New Yorker and even Kennedy's old magazine George continued to profit off the speculation with covers with titles such as ""Kennedy for President?""

(Picture 2) JFK Jr. at first just tried to ignore the speculation and pressure, privately brushing off Democratic bigwigs like Daschle, Clinton and others. However, the media coverage surrounding him, as well as the speculation grew, and his now-pregnant wife Carolyn Bessette and sister Caroline told him to respond to the speculation just for the sake of brushing off the media.

At first, Kennedy tried using his tried and tested Kennedy charm and wit that he inherited from his late father. One day, whilst being hounded by reporters during a morning jog in Midtown Manhattan, JFK Jr. stated to the press:

""I could see myself on a hammock at a beach house on Long Island, so of course I could see myself in the White House one day.""

Unfortantely for him and his family, this statement didnt calm down matters. In fact, it only caused the speculation to further grow, frusterating John, Caroline and Carolyn.

(Picture 3) By the time 2001 turned into 2002, the speculation had only grown and grown, with reporters hounding the Kennedy family on the daily about the matter. So, the elder Kennedys came in to John's aid.

His uncle, Ted Kennedy, is one of the most senior members of the Senate, being there for 40 years at this rate, and once ran for President himself in 1980. According to reports from news orgs such as the New York Times, the elder Kennedy had advised him to ""weigh his options"" and to ""be very careful"" when it comes to a decision like this. 

The Kennedy family was also reportedly divided over this issue. Members such as Ted, Caroline, Carolyn and Ethel werent a fan of the idea, citing the fact that John's political career was in it's early years. 

On the other hand, members such as Patrick, Joe II, RFK Jr., and even Maria Shriver urged John to go for it, citing the fact that he could be the only hope for Democrats in '04 against President Bush.

(Picture 4) In the early summer of 2002, John F. Kennedy Jr. had made his made up. In an interview with the New York Post, Kennedy had made it clear that he had no intentions of making any run for the Presidency in 2004. This came as for a short while, his private life was under scrutiny due to footage of his private wedding of himself and his wife Caroyln being leaked to the public, much to John's displeasement and Carolyn's anger. 

While most understood his decision, some Democrats would later resent him for it, with long-time Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi later allegedly telling John that ""you may have just costed us the White House"".

And you giggle when he and Vance stick it to the immigrants by making outlandish charges. Well, look where it leads. Your kids go to the threatened schools, too. Sure, so far the cowardly bomb threats and assassinations in Springfield, Ohio, have been as false as Trump's promises, but when will that change? Face it, thus far nearly every shooter has been from a heavily armed family -- and they aren't Democrats.

When will one of you red-eyed, malignant MAGA morons, go overboard on the provocative lies and actually make good on the threats. You know who I mean, the ones already on the edge -- the disaffected and disturbed -- those who require only a little more goading and incitement to believe, like the Insurgents of 1/6, that he is following out Trump's orders.

**For the second day in a row,** elementary school children in Springfield, Ohio, were forced to be **due to threats: a bomb threat on Thursday and an unspecified threat on Friday.** The threats come after **Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance,** have repeatedly **spread lies** about Haitian immigrants in Springfield this week, including that they are **stealing residents’ cats and dogs and eating them.**

Thursday’s **bomb threat specifically mentioned the false claims** about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets, USA Today reported.

“Three schools in Springfield were evacuated or closed Friday, based on guidance from police, school officials said,” local NBC affiliate WLWT reports. “Officials with the Springfield City School District said that based on information they got from the Springfield Police Division, **students at Perrin Woods and Snowhill Elementary were evacuated** and moved to another district location.”

A Springfield middle school was also ordered closed Friday morning, before classes began, and “at least one Springfield location of the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles is closed.”

On Thursday, a **bomb threat targeting Springfield city hall** and an elementary school forced evacuations of those buildings.

“Police Chief Allison Elliott said that due to the

officials evacuated multiple buildings in addition to City Hall, including BMV Springfield Driver’s Exam Station, Ohio License Bureau Southside, Springfield Academy of Excellence and Fulton Elementary School.”

Despite the reports of the bomb threat on Thursday, hours late**r Donald Trump** used his Truth Social platform to promote the Republican nominee working to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, by **spreading more anti-Haitian immigrant racism.**

There's ore, much more:

Law_and_Politics,1fgh4ju,Republicans will fall away from Trump’s base before the election ,"Question?
How do you win an election when 60%-65% of all women and 80%-85% of people of color vote for the other candidate? (That’s not even counting the other voters he’s lost including REPUBLICANS because of Jan 6 and on and on.)
Answer: You can’t.

What sane person would go to a conference of black journalists and say the racist things Trump did?

It was the equivalent of showing up in black face.  Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of black votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. Only a crazy person would do that, right?

What sane person would appear on the most watched Presidential debate in history and claim that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs? 

Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Haitian-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

What sane person would go on a debate stage in front of the world and refuse to support Poland in the war against Russian aggression?

Trump had to know he was going to lose countless numbers of Polish-Americans votes he desperately needed after saying the things he did. 

Only a crazy person would do that, right?

Let’s be honest. Trump needs every vote he can get and yet he is even alienating his own base.

Trump has done nothing but reinforce the opinions of people who believe him to be crazy.

Now that Trump has proven to most Americans he is crazy, many Republicans have disassociated themselves. Typically these Republicans want to make it clear they aren’t MAGA. 

More and more, people don’t want to be known as someone who supported Trump. Who can blame them?  People think Trump is crazy and so what does that say about his supporters?

Mark my words, after Trump loses the election in November it won’t be long before Trump supporters will deny they supported Trump.

They will be telling their family and friends that they knew some MAGA people who overdosed on Trump but they weren’t a part of those crazy folks.",Quietdogg77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1fgh4ju/republicans_will_fall_away_from_trumps_base/,/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1fgh4ju/republicans_will_fall_away_from_trumps_base/,13,2024-09-14 07:59:13,62,,False,0.93,None,2024-09-14 12:19:15.972771

Law_and_Politics,1fg37vj,Why Grumpy Cats in Springfield Ohio hate Haitians,"I've seen conservatives posting that Springfield residents have the right to feel their town is being ""overtaken"" by Haitian immigrants. 

To compare, I know a town near a rapidly growing city in Texas. Texas, by the way, takes deep pride in being attractive to new businesses, especially tech businesses like Apple and Dell and Oracle and Tesla and Google. The residents in that town love the tech businesses that come and provide jobs, but they despise the obvious implication that the city will expand so that the town is now a suburb, and that the people with the jobs will actually move into their town, and that the demographics of the tech sector are different than the traditional town residents. 

They literally rant that city folk are not welcome in the town, that Californian immigrants are not welcome in the town, that South Asian and East Asian people (most of which are US citizens, by the way) are contaminating the town with different kinds of restaurants and social gathering places, that the high salaries of tech employees are causing property values to go up and causing taxes to go up. 

This is a tale as old as time. My father remembered the Italian, Irish, and Polish immigrations into NYC and how people reacted exactly the same way.

My point is, this is how America works. Success breeds incoming movement of people, and there will not be stasis but growth, and there will not be a static culture but a changing one. If you want zero growth and stasis of culture, I know a number of towns in a lot of states that fit that description. They've commonly had 3000 people since 1947, there are no jobs, and kids who graduate from high school there work like crazy to get the hell out.

Law_and_Politics,1ffss8s,"Dogs, fraud, and asylums: Trump triples down on conspiracies amid debate delirium.","

# Glowering like a puppy about to be eaten by an immigrant, Trump made a bigger jackass out of himself than he usually does. With steely eyes reflecting his absolute hatred of any kind of truth, he went with his old hits. He continued with his usual inane silliness about his election being fixed (confidentially, it was. Me and eighty of my co-conspirators each voted a million times), and without an iota of evidence claimed millions of recently released nuts from insane asylums are flooding into our country, What he didn't tell you, is they are all MAGA; where do you think these whackjobs come from?

Ah, but there is more -- so much more. With red-eyed malice and gibberish oozing from between his store-bought teeth, he continued to mouth other absurdities meant not for the general audience, but the dullards of MAGA.

He railed about immigrants eating Fluffy and Spot, he moaned about imaginary gangs of imaginary thugs (you know, like the insurrectionists of 1/6), he baselessly accused Nancy Pelosi of being in charge of security on 1/6, and he threatened to kill Obamacare, though he admitted he had no plan to replace it. He had apoplexy when it was pointed out masses of people abandon his rallies because of boredom. He rambled and gave a flustered response when asked why he killed the border bill his own party authored.

He claimed Harris was busing people to her rallies and paying them to be there. But, as usual, it was yet another lie meant to set the back-alley wanderers of MAGA's hair on fire.

Ah, but the highpoint of the evening actually came after the debate. The mega-MAGA-moron complained ABC fact checked him, essentially confirming he did unashamedly lie.

Trump is a criminal, a danger to our democracy, and he now confirms he's stupid, too.

Law_and_Politics,1ffgwqz,They’re eating dogs!,"Isn’t it time to cut the BS?

Trump is truth for MAGAs. 
If Trump says the Haitians are eating cats, that’s their truth.

For non-MAGAs Trump is an unhinged, unfit lunatic who is a convicted felon and a sex offender.  
It’s obvious to non-MAGAs he’s unfit for the office of the Presidency.

Now undecideds and Independents can decide for themselves who’s telling the truth about immigrants eating cats.

It’s so absurd that MAGAs feel they have to torture logic and try to convince the rest of us that their guy is not a raving loon.  

It must be exhausting to have to attempt to explain, walk back, and try to make Trump look and sound sane almost everyday to everyone except other MAGAs.

The truth hurts. It’s simple - but for a shrinking group of Americans it’s painful.

Question?

How do you win an election when 60%-65% of all women and 80%-85% of people of color vote for the other candidate?

Answer: You can’t.

Here’s another painful truth: 

This truth will happen right before your eyes sooner than you realize.

“Patriots” of the MAGA cult will deny they ever were a part of it. Their kids and grandchildren will ask them about the crazy Orange guy named Trump and if they were a MAGA follower.

They”ll deny they were part of supporting Trump because Trump has shown himself to be crazy.  No one really wants to be known as crazy or as someone who supported a crazy person.

MAGAs will say that they knew some people who overdosed on Trump but they will deny they were part of those crazy folks.

Law_and_Politics,1ffdjdr,So here is how the Trumpism slide will happen from here.,"The Trump-Harris debate was a disaster for Trump, and he will not do another with her. This is the catalytic apex that changes a lot of things, and the descent will accelerate. Some key observations and predictions:

* Harris showed that he was easily manipulable, and she did that by manipulating him while he watched. She THEN tied that to his pals, the dictators, and seeded the realization that he has confused ""friendship"" with being used.
* She also laughed at his lies, like the crowd size thing Obama already nailed him on. This allowed non-opponents (like the media) to fact-check him *live and to his face*, which has has rarely if ever encountered. Fact-checking and publicly calling him out will become a new norm, rather than being just in the liberal media. He will have refuge in fewer and fewer media sources that won't do it, and he'll be trapped. This will also happen to the arch-loyalists around him like Miller, Loomer, and Watters, who will literally shriek at being challenged at every turn.
* He will swiftly stop making no-questions statements to the press, and as the press questions get more pressing, he'll stop talking talking to the press at all.
* Poll numbers will never stop growing for Harris or sliding for Trump before the election. He'll stop talking about them. The biggest thing that concerns him will be the huge uptick in voter registration in 18-22 year olds and in urban and suburban women. He will suggest to Vance in private that he not say one damn thing about women.
* There's even odds his DJT stock (now at 16.08 and falling) will fall below 12.00 and he will no longer be able to cash out a week from now. This was his protection from the lawsuit judgements against him, up into the hundreds of millions of dollars, which will start being called in within a month.
* Speaking of crowd sizes, now that he has no debates on his schedule, his on-the-road schedule will be the only substantive thing to do, and now he will OBSESS at the crowd size. Empty seats and people leaving will now be all he sees, wherever he goes, and it will eat at him, even causing him to lose his train of thought while speaking. His speeches will start to get shorter as he reacts to that. He will start to drop some engagements in important states.
* The Republican congressfolk will decide to walk away from his demand to shut everything down, because they know that solidarity with Trump on this will likely cost their own elections. His grip will be seen as loosening.
* It will be noted that Melania is now in NYC to be close to Barron and is spending no time with her husband. Rumors about lawyers being hired will fly. There will be an arrest involving one of his other sons, and this will lead to competition for attorneys between father and son. His loneliness and isolation will become a theme in press stories.
* Shortly before the election, it will become clear that whether Republicans take the Senate is now a toss-up and polls will say the House will be lost to them. Down-ballot anger will seep up to Lara Trump for squandering party money on legal funds, and after the election, she'll be removed.
* The popular vote margin will again be about 10-12%, a surprise to the pollsters, and it will be characterized as a landslide.
* Rather than waiting until after Jan 20, Republicans in the Senate will be advising the MAGA members that they will be removed from all committee assignments and relegated to floor votes only, blaming them for losses.
* And by August 2025, Trump will either be in jail, in a country with no extradition treaty, dead by a stroke or coronary event, dead by his own hand, or dead by a disaffected MAGA voter's hand.",Odd_Bodkin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1ffdjdr/so_here_is_how_the_trumpism_slide_will_happen/,/r/Law_and_Politics/comments/1ffdjdr/so_here_is_how_the_trumpism_slide_will_happen/,139,2024-09-12 21:10:03,654,,False,0.99,None,2024-09-14 12:19:15.972771

moderatepolitics,1ffp3tk,"After Bomb Threats and Political Vitriol, Ohio Mayor Says Enough","I found this article, among many about this issue, quite telling. We all have heard Trump and JD saying that Haitians are eating pets and killing people.  

What I found most interesting here is that the mayor of this town specifically calls out the reactions (bomb threats called against the town hall etc) as a “hateful response to immigration in our town.” Local people are angry about the use of their town as a political flashpoint, saying that “national politicians, on the national stage, [are] mischaracteriz[ing] what is actually going on and misrepresent[ing] our community.” Business leaders have spoken about how good the immigrants have been as workers. 

Specifically, JD Vance and republicans are claiming a person was murdered. This person’s own father has made multiple statements against these false claims. To me, it is disgusting that the GOP is using someone’s death for political gain in direct opposition to the statements of that person’s family.

I am troubled that we are at this point. It demonstrates to me how divided we are and how many don’t care about facts if a statement advances a message. It is totally fair to disagree but the level of “othering” and the exploitation of differences and of tragedies is appalling.",waupli,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/springfield-ohio-bomb-threat-trump-pets.html?unlocked_article_code=1.KU4.FJXN.rQuaLmZSsUJK&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=c-cb,/r/moderatepolitics/comments/1ffp3tk/after_bomb_threats_and_political_vitriol_ohio/,509,2024-09-13 07:40:09,417,,False,0.85,News Article,2024-09-14 12:19:18.570119

moderatepolitics,1feod4v,"The claim constantly repeated by Trump that Governor Northam supports ""post birth abortions"" is blatantly false","This discussion has been brought up a lot, but in the context of the debate last night I think it is important to reiterate what exactly was being talked about by Northam in that interview and the context that is commonly left out from it, that is used to conflate his statement with baby executions

In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6WD_3H0wKU&t=2324s) interview, Northam (A pediatric neurosurgeon) is being asked about a bill that would lift restrictions on third trimester abortions. Asking if he supports the bill, this is his answer:

> ""I wasn't there Julie and I certainly can't speak for delegate Tran but I will tell you one first thing. I would say this is why decisions such as this should be made by providers physicians and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third trimester abortions these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician by the way, and it's **done in cases where there may be severe deformities.** There may be a **fetus that's non-viable so in this particular example** if a mother is in labor I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. I think this was really blown out of proportion but again we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions""

Northam obviously brings up a great point that third trimester abortions are not only exceedingly rare, but are being done in cases where a fetus is non-viable or has significant deformities that make it incompatible with life. 

Now Northam here even takes a stance against a provision of the bill, when asked:

> And do you think multiple physicians should have to weigh in as is currently required she's trying to lift that requirement?

He answers:

> Well I think it's always good to get a second opinion and for at least two providers to be involved in that decision because these decisions shouldn't be taken lightly and so you know I would certainly support more than one provider

It's pretty clear that since not only was the ignorant statement by the VA House Delegate walked back by her, Northam has an understanding and nuanced approach to the issue that gets lost when more than half his statement is removed",ubermence,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/1feod4v/the_claim_constantly_repeated_by_trump_that/,/r/moderatepolitics/comments/1feod4v/the_claim_constantly_repeated_by_trump_that/,218,2024-09-11 23:28:30,206,,False,0.72,Discussion,2024-09-14 12:19:18.570119

WomenInNews,1fggnt5,Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said she should have quit the court for her autistic daughter. I quit my job too for the same reason and I’m also a feminist. ,"Feminism is self-determinism. When I decided that my child needed my help to the extent where only I would do and I decided to sacrifice my career, no one else
should have had an opinion other than support. It killed me to see the business go that I had spent five years building but both of my girls started thriving immediately. This IS NOT an attack on working moms who do not have the luxury to stay home with a child. Yes, there is an inequity in that my husband makes more in tech and I make less in the arts and perhaps internalized gender roles have pushed the narrative that I should be the caretaker. However, I believe it’s critical life-centered work with those I most love.
It’s made me happier to just focus on my girls for a few years while I still have them.
Thank you, Justice Brown for humanizing the issue for so many millions of working moms",Relative-Ability8179,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenInNews/comments/1fggnt5/judge_ketanji_brown_jackson_said_she_should_have/,/r/WomenInNews/comments/1fggnt5/judge_ketanji_brown_jackson_said_she_should_have/,4,2024-09-14 07:21:38,40,,False,0.9,None,2024-09-14 12:19:19.529617

uspolitics,1fejmw2,Social Security COLA 2025: Seniors can expect lowest cost-of-living increase since 2021," 
 

A survey conducted by the Senior Citizens League found 65% of seniors reported monthly expenses of at least $2,000, up from 55% in 2023. 

""Due to a higher cost of living, older Americans are using more and more of their income each month just to get by compared to a year ago,"" the League said Wednesday.

Much of the political debate about Social Security remains focused on reforming — and ultimately paring back — the entire program. But earlier this year, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania introduced the Boosting Benefits and COLAs for Seniors Act, designed to increase Social Security benefits at a rate ""that actually reflects the costs seniors face.""

The bill would tie COLAs to an alternative inflation index created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that is designed to more accurately reflect prices paid by Americans aged 62 or older.

“For millions of older adults in Pennsylvania and across the Nation, Social Security is the promise of a safe and stable retirement,” Casey, who is in a tight re-election race, said in a statement when he introduced the bill. 

“As the costs of basic goods and services for seniors rise, we cannot allow that promise to be broken,"" he said.

I'm not trying to say she didn't explain her policys or her views on certain things. She did and she did what was expected to do. Simply explain to her supporters what she has planned and what can happen if she gets into office. Besides the point, her rallys were pretty much on par with what we expected. Back to the debate. It seems like she saved and planned everything very well for the debate. She kept her composure *with some exceptions*, stated the differences between her and Trump's policy's, She directed mostly everything she said to us the people.

PresidentialElection,1ffejno,What to Take Away from the Harris-Trump Debate,"Here's a breakdown of how each candidate performed during the debate, their key points, strengths, weaknesses, and overall vision for America.

Vice President Kamala Harris
Performance: Kamala Harris presented herself as a forward-looking candidate, emphasizing optimism and a vision for progress. Throughout the debate, she highlighted the achievements of the current administration, such as job creation and investment in clean energy. Harris portrayed herself as a protector of fundamental rights, particularly women’s rights, and repeatedly mentioned her dedication to the people, using her career as a prosecutor and public servant to underline her commitment to fairness and justice.

Ideas & Vision:
Economy: Harris's focus was on creating an ""opportunity economy"", investing in small businesses, families, seniors, and reducing the cost of living. She also spoke about growing the clean energy economy, investing in American manufacturing, and securing job growth.

Climate Change: Harris portrayed climate change as an existential threat and emphasized the administration’s efforts to invest in renewable energy, while maintaining the production of domestic gas. She framed climate policy as a key component of the economy and job creation.

National Security & Global Standing: Harris stressed the importance of maintaining America’s military strength and standing in the world, advocating for diplomacy and international respect.
Social Issues: She was vocal about defending fundamental rights, particularly women's rights, and emphasized inclusivity and unity, arguing that Americans have more in common than what divides them.

Strengths:
Positive Vision: Harris’s forward-looking message aimed to inspire hope, especially regarding economic opportunities, clean energy, and social progress.

Track Record: She leaned on her experience as a public servant, framing herself as someone with a deep connection to the needs of the people and as a problem-solver.

Energy & Climate: She positioned the administration’s investments in clean energy as a job creator and a global leader in addressing climate change, appealing to younger voters concerned with environmental issues.

Weaknesses:
Defense vs. Action: While she mentioned the administration's achievements, Trump criticized her for not addressing key issues like the border crisis during her time in office. This put her in a defensive position, and her rebuttals sometimes felt more reactive than proactive.

Vague on Specific Plans: Harris's broader vision, while optimistic, sometimes lacked concrete steps for how the changes would be implemented, particularly in terms of lowering costs or dealing with the border.

Former President Donald Trump
Performance: Donald Trump positioned himself as a critic of the current administration, focusing on their failures and presenting himself as the solution to America’s decline. His style was direct, and his messaging centered on America’s economic and military strength, making frequent references to international respect and security. Trump was aggressive in pointing out problems he believed the current administration has worsened, particularly with regard to energy policy, immigration, and foreign policy.

Ideas & Vision:
Economy & Jobs: Trump emphasized restoring America’s manufacturing sector and preventing jobs from being outsourced, particularly to countries like China and Mexico. He was critical of the administration’s handling of auto manufacturing and proposed imposing tariffs to protect American jobs.

Energy Policy: Trump was clear about his support for fossil fuels, arguing that a shift away from oil and gas would weaken the economy. He repeatedly suggested that America isn’t ready for a complete transition to renewable energy and pointed to failures in other countries as a warning.

Foreign Policy & National Security: He spoke about restoring America’s global standing and preventing World War III, criticizing the administration for allowing conflicts such as the war in Ukraine to escalate. He also took a hard line on immigration, claiming that the current administration has allowed criminals into the country.

Corruption Allegations: A significant portion of Trump's critique focused on corruption claims, particularly against Joe Biden and his family, accusing the current administration of compromising national interests for personal gain.

Strengths:
Critique of the Status Quo: Trump’s ability to tap into frustrations with the current administration’s handling of key issues like immigration, energy, and foreign policy played to his strength as an outsider. His rhetoric about America being laughed at globally resonated with voters seeking a return to strength and international leadership.

Clear Position on Energy: He offered a simple, clear message on energy, advocating for fossil fuel use and portraying the shift to clean energy as premature and economically harmful, appealing to voters in traditional energy sectors.

Strong & Direct Language: Trump’s forceful style and unapologetic stance on issues like trade, national security, and immigration gave him an image of strength, particularly for voters seeking decisive leadership.

Weaknesses:
Negativity: Trump’s messaging was heavily focused on what the current administration was doing wrong, often without offering specific alternatives or solutions. His tone may have alienated some voters looking for a more positive vision for the future.

Repetitive Messaging: While Trump hammered on familiar themes (corruption, immigration, energy), this repetition may have come across as overly simplistic or lacking in fresh ideas for voters seeking innovation or detail in policy solutions.

Lack of Forward-Looking Vision: Trump’s vision for America was largely framed around preventing decline rather than a clear, positive agenda for the future, which could have made his message feel backward-looking compared to Harris's emphasis on new opportunities.

Overall Comparison:
Kamala Harris presented an optimistic and progress-oriented vision, focused on investment in the economy, climate action, and protecting fundamental rights. Her strength lay in highlighting the administration’s accomplishments and painting a hopeful picture of the future. However, she sometimes struggled to clearly differentiate her vision from the current administration’s policies, making it easy for Trump to critique her lack of progress on key issues.

Donald Trump took a more critical approach, framing the current administration as incompetent and America as being in decline. His strength was in his direct, simple messaging about energy and jobs, tapping into frustration with the status quo. However, his focus on negatives, along with a lack of clear forward-looking policies, may have limited his appeal to voters looking for solutions rather than critiques.

Both candidates played to their established bases, with Harris aiming to inspire hope for the future and Trump appealing to those frustrated with the current administration’s handling of economic and global issues. The choice presented was between Harris’s optimism and progress versus Trump’s focus on strength and restoration.",TheGFromTheNE,https://www.reddit.com/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1ffejno/what_to_take_away_from_the_harristrump_debate/,/r/PresidentialElection/comments/1ffejno/what_to_take_away_from_the_harristrump_debate/,3,2024-09-12 21:54:20,6,,False,0.8,None,2024-09-14 12:19:24.362149
PresidentialElection,1ffegsd,Detailed Summary of the Harris-Trump Debate,"The opening of the debate sets a historic tone as David Muir and Linsey Davis introduce the highly anticipated first face-to-face meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. With President Biden having withdrawn from the race just weeks earlier, Harris steps into the national spotlight, facing Trump in a pivotal moment for both campaigns. The introduction emphasizes the significance of the debate, noting that the candidates are tied in national polls, with battleground states, including Pennsylvania, still up for grabs.

David Muir explains the rules of the debate, detailing the format: 90 minutes with two commercial breaks, no shared topics or questions with the campaigns, and strict time limits for responses and rebuttals. The setting is designed to be intimate, with no live audience in the hall of the National Constitution Center. The absence of a crowd is meant to focus attention squarely on the two candidates, who, notably, have never met before this moment. The rules are designed to ensure a structured and fair exchange between Harris and Trump, with microphones only active when it is each candidate's turn to speak.

Finally, the stage is set as the moderators reveal the results of the coin toss. President Trump has opted to deliver the closing statement at the end of the debate, while Vice President Harris selected the right-side podium. This marks the start of what is described as a potentially decisive moment in their campaigns, with both candidates about to engage in their first direct confrontation as Election Day looms just two months away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2nd part of the debate begins with a civil introduction between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, shaking hands and exchanging brief pleasantries. David Muir sets the stage for the first major topic: the economy and the cost of living, which voters have identified as their top concern. Muir prompts Harris to reflect on whether Americans are better off economically than they were four years ago, particularly since she and Biden took office. Harris presents her ""opportunity economy"" plan, which focuses on supporting middle-class families, addressing housing shortages, and expanding the child tax credit. She emphasizes her dedication to small businesses, proposing a $50,000 tax deduction for startups, and criticizes Trump’s previous tax cuts, framing them as favoring billionaires and corporations at the expense of middle-class Americans.

In response, Trump dismisses Harris's claims, denying any intent to implement a ""sales tax"" and instead advocating for tariffs on other countries. He credits his previous administration for implementing tariffs that generated significant revenue, particularly from China. Trump blames inflation and economic hardship on the Biden-Harris administration, painting a bleak picture of the country's current state, particularly for the middle class. He also raises concerns about immigration, alleging that dangerous individuals have entered the country and are taking jobs from Americans, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and union workers. Trump concludes by promising to rebuild the economy better than before, leveraging his past achievements as evidence.

Harris counters Trump's points by highlighting the economic struggles inherited from his presidency, including high unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the January 6th insurrection. She accuses Trump of offering no substantive plan for the future and warns of the dangers of his so-called ""Project 2025."" Trump dismisses this, asserting that he has no connection to the project and reiterates his intention to cut taxes and restore the economy. Harris cites reports from top economists and institutions like Goldman Sachs and the Wharton School, asserting that Trump's plans would worsen inflation and potentially lead to a recession, while her ""opportunity economy"" plan would strengthen the nation's financial standing. Trump refutes this, claiming that Harris's economic plan is a weak imitation of Biden’s and lacking in substance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 3rd part of the debate, David Muir focuses on tariffs, asking former President Trump about his proposal to impose up to 20% tariffs on foreign imports and the potential impact on American consumers. Trump defends his plan, claiming it won’t raise prices for Americans, instead suggesting that countries like China would bear the costs. He argues that under his administration, the U.S. experienced no inflation and emphasizes that current economic conditions under the Biden administration are dire, with people struggling to afford basic necessities.

Vice President Harris responds by pointing out that Trump's trade policies, including trade wars and a growing trade deficit, hurt the U.S. economy. She criticizes his handling of relations with China, particularly his sale of American technology that could aid China’s military development, and contrasts this with her focus on American technological investment and workforce rights. She also highlights Trump's praise for President Xi Jinping during the COVID-19 pandemic, which she sees as a failure in leadership.

Trump counters by claiming that the U.S. no longer manufactures many chips, blaming policies like those under Harris and Biden. He accuses Harris of adopting his policies while labeling her a Marxist, citing her father’s influence. He reiterates concerns about immigration, claiming that large numbers of criminals are entering the country, which he says harms both the economy and public safety.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 4th portion of the debate, Linsey Davis asks former President Donald Trump about his changing stance on abortion, particularly his initial opposition to Florida's six-week abortion ban, followed by his eventual support. Trump responds by attacking Democrats, claiming they support extreme positions like abortion up to the ninth month or even after birth. He emphasizes his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, bringing abortion decisions back to the states, and defending his position by supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. He praises the courage of the six Supreme Court justices in achieving this shift and asserts that now, states are voting on the issue, marking a historic victory for democracy.

Vice President Kamala Harris counters by accusing Trump of spreading lies and recounts how he deliberately selected Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. She highlights the harm of ""Trump abortion bans,"" which criminalize healthcare providers and deny care to women, especially in cases of rape and incest. Harris pledges to sign a bill reinstating Roe v. Wade protections if elected, warning that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if re-elected. She condemns the idea of the government controlling women's reproductive rights, emphasizing that the majority of Americans support the freedom to make personal decisions.

Trump dismisses Harris’s claims as lies, reiterating that the issue is now with the states and denying that he supports a national abortion ban. He shifts the focus back to Harris, questioning whether she would support abortions in the later months of pregnancy. Harris maintains that Trump is misleading the public, and she argues that women across the country are suffering under restrictive abortion laws that limit their healthcare access. The debate on abortion becomes a battle of personal and political ideologies, with both candidates emphasizing their stance on this deeply divisive issue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 5th segment of the debate, David Muir asks Vice President Kamala Harris to respond briefly to the idea that Donald Trump would use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to target political opponents if re-elected. Harris emphasizes that the 2024 election is happening in a crucial context, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling that could allow Trump to be immune from legal consequences if he returns to office. She warns that Trump has openly talked about terminating the U.S. Constitution and would misuse the DOJ to attack political enemies. She also highlights his disrespect for the military and urges voters to recognize the potential dangers of Trump regaining the presidency without legal or institutional checks to stop him, leaving the responsibility to the American people.

Trump interrupts after Harris’s remarks, asserting that Harris, not him, has weaponized the DOJ. He insists he has been unfairly targeted, comparing it to ""taking a bullet to the head"" due to the attacks against him. He continues by dismissing claims that he is a threat to democracy, instead arguing that Democrats are the real threat, citing the failed ""Russia investigation"" as an example. This exchange further intensifies the debate on the rule of law, democracy, and the role of the justice system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 6th part of the debate, Linsey Davis questions Vice President Kamala Harris about shifts in her policy positions on key issues such as fracking, assault weapon buyback programs, and border decriminalization. Harris responds by asserting that her values have remained consistent, though policies have evolved. She clarifies her stance on fracking, emphasizing that she does not support banning it and highlights her involvement in the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new fracking leases. Harris frames her policy positions in terms of her upbringing, experiences, and values, focusing on home ownership, protecting the vulnerable, and maintaining social security and Medicare. She also emphasizes the importance of leadership that uplifts people rather than engages in divisive rhetoric.

Donald Trump responds by disputing the claim that he inherited $400 million, instead stating that he received a much smaller amount, which he built into billions. He accuses Harris of changing her stances on fracking, defunding the police, and other policies, asserting that her previous positions were more radical. Trump criticizes Harris for allegedly supporting the release of violent criminals and claims she would shut down fracking in Pennsylvania if elected, while also criticizing her stance on fossil fuels. Davis cuts in, noting they have run out of time for that segment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 7th segment of the debate, David Muir presses former President Donald Trump about his role in the events of January 6th, specifically asking if he has any regrets. Trump defends his actions, emphasizing that he called for peaceful protests and blaming the violence on failures by Nancy Pelosi and Washington, D.C. leadership. He shifts the conversation to other issues, such as the handling of immigration and the prosecution of rioters in cities like Seattle and Minneapolis, while avoiding directly answering the question. Muir persists, seeking a clear response regarding Trump’s conduct during the Capitol riot.

Vice President Kamala Harris responds, condemning Trump’s actions on January 6th and linking them to other instances of his leadership that she views as dangerous, such as his response to Charlottesville. Harris argues that Trump’s rhetoric has consistently been harmful to democracy and that it is crucial to move forward rather than return to his style of governance. She invites those disillusioned with Trump’s behavior to join her campaign for a more stable and lawful future.

Muir transitions the discussion to Trump’s refusal to fully acknowledge his 2020 election loss, which he continues to claim was stolen. Trump dismisses Muir’s point about the courts rejecting his claims, insisting the cases were dismissed on technical grounds, not merit. He reiterates his belief that the U.S. is in decline under current leadership, focusing on immigration and electoral integrity. Harris counters, pointing out that Trump’s continued denial of the election results undermines democracy and reflects poorly on him internationally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 8th part of the debate, Linsey Davis shifts the focus to the Israel-Hamas war and the ongoing hostage situation, asking Vice President Kamala Harris about her stance. Harris reiterates that while Israel has a right to defend itself, it must do so with care to avoid civilian casualties. She emphasizes the need for a ceasefire and a two-state solution that ensures security and dignity for both Israelis and Palestinians. She also expresses ongoing support for Israel’s defense, particularly against threats from Iran and its proxies.

Former President Donald Trump responds to a question about how he would negotiate in the current situation. He asserts that the conflict would not have occurred under his leadership, making comparisons to his approach to Russia and Ukraine. Trump criticizes Harris, accusing her of hating Israel and linking her foreign policy stance to a potential decline in Israel’s security. He also blames the Biden administration for strengthening Iran through lifted sanctions, which he argues have funded terrorist activities.

Harris counters Trump's accusations, denying any animosity toward Israel. She condemns Trump’s relationships with dictators, arguing that his foreign policy has made the U.S. appear weak. Harris also highlights Trump's record of admiring autocrats and claims that military leaders view him as a national security liability. Trump responds by attacking the Biden administration's handling of foreign policy, especially its approach to Russia and the Keystone pipeline. The exchange ends as Davis interrupts to move the debate forward.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 9th part of the debate, David Muir turns the conversation to the war in Ukraine, asking Donald Trump how he would resolve the conflict and whether he wants Ukraine to win. Trump emphasizes his desire to end the war quickly to save lives, claiming millions have died and criticizing the Biden administration for not pressuring Europe to contribute equally to the war effort. He asserts that his relationships with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy would allow him to broker peace swiftly, blaming Biden for the war’s escalation and warning of the risk of World War III.

Vice President Kamala Harris responds, asserting that Trump’s quick resolution plan likely involves surrendering to Russia, which she argues is un-American. She recounts her meetings with Zelenskyy before the invasion and emphasizes the importance of defending sovereignty and territorial integrity. Harris credits the Biden administration's support for Ukraine’s ongoing independence and freedom, warning that under Trump, Putin would have already captured Kyiv and would threaten Europe. She underscores the value of NATO and criticizes Trump’s stance on favoring dictators.
Trump rebuts, arguing that Putin would have been better off and happier under his leadership, emphasizing that Putin’s nuclear arsenal is a significant factor that must be considered. He criticizes Harris’ diplomatic efforts, accusing her of weak negotiations that led directly to the war. Harris refutes this claim, reiterating the importance of U.S. leadership and alliances in global stability and democracy, while Trump highlights his success in getting NATO countries to increase their financial contributions during his presidency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 10th portion of the debate, David Muir shifts the conversation to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, asking Vice President Kamala Harris if she feels responsible for how it unfolded. Harris responds by standing behind President Biden’s decision to pull out, emphasizing that Biden succeeded where four previous presidents failed by ending a costly war. She highlights the financial relief from the war and notes the absence of American military personnel in active combat zones for the first time in the 21st century. Harris criticizes Donald Trump for negotiating a weak deal with the Taliban, releasing 5,000 terrorists, and inviting them to Camp David, a symbol of U.S. diplomacy, thus undermining the country’s role as a respected leader on the world stage.

In response, Donald Trump defends his administration's negotiations with the Taliban, stating that during his presidency, he got directly involved to prevent further loss of American soldiers. He references his interaction with the Taliban leader Abdul, claiming his firm stance halted violence for 18 months. Trump argues that his deal was successful, asserting that the U.S. could have withdrawn faster and more effectively under his administration without losing soldiers, abandoning Americans, or leaving billions of dollars' worth of military equipment behind. He accuses the Biden administration of botching the withdrawal and suggests that its incompetence led to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Muir attempts to move on, but Trump reiterates that the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal was an embarrassment and directly contributed to global instability, particularly Russia's aggression in Ukraine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 11th segment of the debate, David Muir questions Donald Trump about his past remarks regarding Kamala Harris's racial identity. Trump dismisses the issue, claiming he does not care about her race and deflecting responsibility by suggesting he merely read contradictory reports about her identity. When pressed, he reiterates his indifference, implying Harris's racial background is irrelevant to him. Kamala Harris responds by criticizing Trump for his history of using race to divide Americans, recalling examples such as his discriminatory housing practices, his controversial ad calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, and his promotion of the birther conspiracy against President Obama. Harris argues that most Americans want unity, not division, and advocates for leaders who focus on shared dreams and aspirations, regardless of race.

Trump counters by accusing the current administration of being the most divisive in U.S. history. He defends his position on the Central Park Five, noting that Michael Bloomberg had supported him, and criticizes Harris for bringing up events from decades ago. Trump shifts the focus to his economic record, claiming he built one of the strongest economies in history and can do so again, while also attacking the Biden-Harris administration's policies, particularly on inflation and energy. He asserts that Harris is trying to distance herself from President Biden, whom he blames for the country's economic problems.
In response, Harris emphasizes that she is neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump and offers a ""new generation of leadership."" She highlights her plans to support small businesses, families, and first-time home buyers, contrasting her focus on policy and optimism with Trump's divisive rhetoric. Harris argues for a forward-looking conversation centered on solutions rather than insults. Trump, however, continues his attacks, accusing Harris of wanting to defund the police, confiscate guns, and ban fracking, despite her claims to the contrary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 12th segment of the debate, Linsey Davis asks Donald Trump about his longstanding promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, noting that after multiple attempts, he has not succeeded in providing a replacement plan. Trump criticizes the ACA as ""lousy"" and claims that he inherited it because Democrats refused to amend it. He frames his decision to maintain Obamacare as a moral obligation, despite its flaws, and states that while his administration improved it, it will never be a great system. He asserts that if a better, less expensive alternative is found, he will replace it, but for now, there are only ""concepts"" and options under consideration.

When pressed further on whether he has a concrete plan, Trump acknowledges that he does not have a finalized plan but is working on ideas and options. He defends his stance by emphasizing that he is no longer president, and any future changes would depend on finding a superior alternative to the ACA.

Kamala Harris responds by reaffirming her support for private health care options alongside the ACA. Before addressing health care, she briefly counters Trump's claims about her stance on fracking and gun ownership, calling out his ""continuous lying."" Harris then highlights Trump's numerous failed attempts to repeal the ACA during his presidency, emphasizing that it was Senator John McCain's decisive vote that saved the ACA. She details the ACA's accomplishments, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and touts her administration's achievements, such as capping the cost of insulin and prescription medication for seniors. Harris emphasizes that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and vows to continue strengthening the ACA.

Trump counters by criticizing Harris's stance on private insurance, accusing her of wanting to eliminate it in favor of government-run insurance, which he claims would result in long waits for medical procedures. He insists that private insurance should be preserved for those who work hard and want the option to choose their own health care.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 13th segment of the debate, Linsey Davis introduces the topic of climate change, asking both candidates about their plans to address the issue. Kamala Harris begins by criticizing Donald Trump for previously calling climate change a hoax. She emphasizes the real-world impact of climate change, including extreme weather events and their consequences for homeowners and insurance. Harris highlights her administration's accomplishments in tackling climate change, noting a $1 trillion investment in the clean energy economy and the creation of 800,000 manufacturing jobs. She also points out that during her vice presidency, domestic gas production has increased, and new factories have opened, contradicting Trump's claims about losing manufacturing jobs. Harris is proud of her endorsement from the United Auto Workers, emphasizing the role of clean energy investments in bolstering American-made products and automobile manufacturing.

In response, Donald Trump counters Harris's claims, asserting that manufacturing jobs have continued to be lost, with 10,000 manufacturing jobs disappearing in the last month. He accuses the current administration of allowing jobs and auto plants to be relocated to Mexico, many of which are owned by China. Trump vows to impose tariffs on foreign-made cars to protect American auto workers and prevent these plants from undermining U.S. manufacturing. He also launches a broad attack on President Biden, accusing him and his son of corruption and financial ties to countries like China and Ukraine, claiming that this compromises Biden’s decisions regarding U.S. manufacturing and foreign policy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the closing statements, Vice President Kamala Harris outlines two competing visions for the future of the United States: one focused on progress and the other seeking to return to the past. She advocates for an ""opportunity economy"" that invests in small businesses, families, and seniors, with a focus on lowering the cost of living and maintaining America's global standing. Harris emphasizes her commitment to defending fundamental rights such as a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, highlighting her experience as a prosecutor and public servant. She concludes by pledging to be a president who puts the American people first, aiming to invest in the country's future over the next 10 to 20 years.

In his response, Donald Trump criticizes Harris for not accomplishing the promises she now makes during her 3 1/2 years in office. He argues that Harris and the current administration have failed to secure the border and create jobs, and he claims they have pursued policies that are out of touch with the American people's beliefs, particularly regarding energy. Trump reiterates his stance on the importance of fossil fuels and warns against abandoning them too quickly, using Germany's return to traditional energy sources as an example. He paints a bleak picture of the U.S. as a failing nation, mocked on the world stage, and predicts that current policies will lead to global conflict, including a potential nuclear war. He also accuses Harris of allowing millions of criminals into the country and being part of the worst administration in U.S. history.

The debate ends with Linsey Davis and David Muir thanking viewers and signing off from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, emphasizing the historic nature of the debate.

PresidentialElection,1ff2chb,Democrats have an inherent advantage in the electoral college. ,Democrats have won the popular vote in every election since 2008. They have won the electoral college in 3 out of the last 4 elections. All of the current swing states except for North Carolina went for Biden in 2020. All of the swing states except for Wisconsin and North Carolina have 2 Democratic senators. Every swing state except for Georgia have a Democratic governor. Democrats have a trifecta in Michigan and Pennsylvania and are very close to flipping the Arizona state senate.  Georgia and Arizona have been trending more to the Democrats since Trump won in 2016.

PresidentialElection,1feysnw,Biased and uninformed voting. The real issue of 2024,"Decided to do a self study and wrote this below.

In today's political climate, it seems that many votes are biased and uneducated, regardless of which side you're on. Instead of voting for the future of our country and its policies, too many people are voting out of pettiness, anger, or even hate. This is evident in my recent experience on Reddit.

I posted on two subreddits, one for Democrats and one for Republicans, asking why I should vote for their candidate without mentioning the other. The results were telling.

Democrats, in most cases, couldn't give me a clear reason why I should vote for Harris without bringing up Trump or his past actions. Instead of telling me what Harris can or will do, they defaulted to talking about Trump and his court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade.

On the other hand, Republicans either stayed quiet or gave policy-driven responses. Many highlighted specific issues like support for veterans or addressing inflation. While there were some mentions of corruption or frustrations with the Democratic Party, they generally managed to avoid mentioning Harris altogether and passed the test I set.

This stark contrast is concerning. Voting should be about the future of our country, informed by policies and actions, not driven by hatred or fear of the other side. If we want to move forward, we must focus on what candidates can actually offer instead of getting caught up in emotional reactions or old grudges.

Now, if we were to put aside the hate and truly educate ourselves on the issues, I believe we would have much better elections. This post is made without bias, and I’m not revealing my personal voting choice because that’s not the point. What matters is focusing on the facts and policies, not on emotions or grudges. If we did this, we might have a real chance at becoming united again as a country.

I have tried many times to debate and provide evidence to people, but I’ve found—repeatedly—that they don’t want to spend the time to read or understand what I present to them. Some people are just so caught up in their own beliefs that they begin to ignore all reason. 

Why has it become to the norm to ignore evidence when it goes against what you believe in?

NewsAndPolitics,1ff3a49,Garland praises DOJ for impartiality amid ‘dangerous and outrageous’ attacks,"“The address—to be delivered department-wide—commends their “ironclad commitment to the principles of fairness and impartiality” as he describes unprecedented threats made against the Justice Department”

“Our norms are a promise that we will fiercely protect the independence of this Department from political interference in our criminal investigations.Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this Department to be used as a political weapon,” he said.

Although it was Trump that called out the justice department, the statements by Garland are patently false. There IS a weaponizing the Justice Dept by Zionists.

No political interface, Garland? You sure about that?

If this is true then Garland would not have announced charges against Hamas for the massacre of 1200 Israelis while IGNORING Israel’s massacre of over 41,000 civilians.

Does Garland think all Americans are idiots aside from the GOP?

Welcome to the United States of Zion where hypocrisy reigns supreme and murder by favorites goes unnoticed by a corrupt US Prez, VP, and Congress.

newsradio,1en2jgm,Missed episodes,"So, when I first revisited Newsradio around 20 years ago, I downloaded all of it from a totally ""legal"" site (don't worry, I've since purchased it all on Amazon) and went through it all and loved it even more than when it aired in the 90's. I later found out that my download was missing two episodes, Titanic and Airport. Ever since I have been saving them for a special occasion, kind of like Desmond on Lost saving the Dickens book Our Mutual Friend to be the last book he read before he died. But I have always put it off, no occasion has seemed to fit, it makes me happy to know I live in a world with more Newsradio to watch, etc. So here I am 20 years later, still having never seen those two episodes. I don't know what it will take to push me across that line to watch them--I asked my wife if she wanted to watch them with me and she said sure but she would probably want to watch some of the other episodes to get up to speed (but she also isn't that interested in Newsradio so we haven't ever watched anything to get up to speed.)

newsradio,1eicvpg,"newsradio just solved my 25 year Mandela effect (and also, a discussion of commentaries)","Let me start with the part that’s of no interest to anyone. I’ve been a lifelong Seinfeld fanatic and have always had a memory of a Seinfeld episode (that I only saw once when I was very young) involving a very memorable-to-me blue and purple gym set. Over the years I began to realize that I could never find this episode and eventually concluded it must’ve been some other show, or maybe I was just remembering the set wrong (since there are gym scenes in Seinfeld that are vaguely similar).

I have watched fairly little newsradio in my life, but lately have been watching it with the dvd commentaries (more on that later), and today I discovered that the Seinfeld episode is actually the Ben stiller episode of newsradio. I am 100% sure, it is exactly the set I remember from one viewing probably 25 years ago. And Ben stiller looks vaguely like Jerry Seinfeld. This was a very mind blowing moment. 

Anyway, I’ve been watching the commentaries because I love commentaries and sitcoms in general, hearing about the writing process and the actors’ perspectives on any show. And I have to say, the newsradio commentaries are some of the best ever. Do all the fans know about this? Like, every single commentary is very interesting and informative and open about how everyone in the cast and crew felt about each other and the show. A lot of drama. It’s great stuff

newsradio,1d4n8qb,"Two reasons why NewsRadio is one of my favourite sitcoms, despite watching (and rewatching) the first two seasons only!","Okay, I won't bother you with details - if the show is particularly enjoyable I'm not binging it, I watch next episodes/seasons ""when the time is right"". I started watching *NewsRadio* a few years ago and was immediately hooked, to this day I watched the first two seasons only, and just finished another rewatch of these 28 episodes (and I love that there's 69 more that I can watch someday).

Great writing, familiar and enjoyable setting, likable characters, jokes that vary from clever puns to straight-up slapstick, and all actors are really good (the timing \[jokes\] in particular, say what you will about Andy Dick, but he's also perfect here). But these are not the reasons why the show immediately caught my attention (which doesn't happen often, at least not that fast):

1. Will-they-won't-they trope subverted in the second episode of the series, it wasn't as unique as ""never done before or after"", but just unique enough, in a respectful way towards viewers - the show wasn't pushing something artificial, wasn't trying to hook viewers to a guessing game, romantic comedy or whatever, it took a chance - either it happens (the romance between two MCs) and it works, or it doesn't work, that's something rarely seen in sitcoms (like in *Dharma & Greg* the unlikely relationship is the whole premise of the show, in *NewsRadio* it's just one of the main plot threads, it's not pivotal to the show's existence, and that makes it unique, while other sitcoms usually abuse will-they-won't-they trope \[like by the end of the first season two MCs kiss, and for the whole second season they try to figure out what to do next\]...).

2. Beth mol3sting Bill in the sixth episode, so many reasons why this was so unique - first of all it could be played just for laughs, an attractive female coworker makes a pass at a single male would be a dream come true in i.e. *Two and a Half Men* universe - here Bill feels used, and not in a happy way (it wasn't like: ""an attractive coworker made a pass at me, what's not to like, I'll tease her a bit...""), he felt used as she was his colleague and the whole relationship between them was shaken by her actions (that were just wrong). Not to mention the shift in the usual perspective when it's the female who feels used...

There are other reasons ofc, like extremely funny jokes in these 28 episodes, i.e. I won't be able to think of Buttafuoco without thinking *NewsRadio*.  
Initially I felt that Stephen Root's character's attatchment to WNYX workers was somehow far-fetched, but by a number of rewatches I got that he had a soft spot for them, maybe because they embraced his eccentricity (in the second season he's in the lookout for a future wife, it indicates that he wasn't ""socially"" lucky in the past, possibly not being accepted in the social situations etc.), so him spending so much time with WNYX workers goes beyong the convenient sitcom conventions, it feels like there's an in-universe reason, and it doesn't need to be said out loud.  
Like with Andy Dick - say what you will about Joe Rogan, but the guy was great in *NewsRadio*, and the scope of his success after departure from sitcom acting is on another level...  
I won't even start on Phil Hartman, R.I.P..

What do I know about the 3 seasons I haven't seen yet - there are ""fantasy"" episodes like the Titanic one - love concepts like these, hope it goes literally and figuratively ""overboard"". Also I can see that Tom Cherones takes over as the main director, his work was prominent in *Seinfeld*, another favourite of mine, so I bet there's a lot to look out for (though again - Hartman's fate... for example I have a hard time rewatching *8 Simple Rules* knowing that the show went on without John Ritter...).",Mister_BovineJoni,https://www.reddit.com/r/newsradio/comments/1d4n8qb/two_reasons_why_newsradio_is_one_of_my_favourite/,/r/newsradio/comments/1d4n8qb/two_reasons_why_newsradio_is_one_of_my_favourite/,11,2024-05-31 04:30:57,27,,False,0.84,General discussion,2024-09-14 12:19:33.688175

This WinAmp channel would just stream all episodes on a loop for free. The quality suffered and you couldn't choose the episode, you just kind of tuned in, but it was a pretty easy and reliable way to watch this show on my PC.

When Lisa was News Director, he brushed her off when she wanted to talk about work affairs in order to just shoot the shit with Dave.

mopolitics,1ffvyey,"Trump, Twitter, and truth judgments: The effects of “disputed” tags and political knowledge on the judged truthfulness of election misinformation","I think this new study is worth reading but here’s a high-level summary:

> Finding 1: Overall, “disputed” tags were ineffective at curbing misinformation among Trump voters. Trump voters with high political knowledge judged Donald Trump’s election misinformation as more truthful when his posts included disputed tags compared to the control condition.

> Finding 2: Trump voters that were initially skeptical of mass election fraud were more likely to perceive Donald Trump’s misinformation as truthful in the disputed tag condition compared to the control.

> Finding 3: Disputed tags failed to meaningfully change pre-existing beliefs about election fraud or fairness.

mopolitics,1eqfsol,US support for Israel is collapsing. And Aipac knows it | Yousef Munayyer,">Over the last two decades, we have seen quite a remarkable shift in opinion on this issue among Democrats in particular. Numerous public opinion polls all provide evidence of the same trend. Democrats especially, but also independents, have grown less sympathetic to Israel over time. A Pew poll from March 2023 found that for the first time, Democrats had more sympathy for Palestinians than Israelis. Importantly, if you look at the charts, the beginning of a clear and steady nose dive that would continue for the next decade is between 2014 and 2015. What happened then? Israel’s horrific month-and-a-half-long war on Gaza which destroyed swaths of civilian infrastructure and killed about 1,500 civilians, most of whom were women and children, is what happened. The barbarity displayed by the Israeli military and the havoc wreaked on Gaza led many Americans to turn away in dismay and ask why their government continues to fund the Israeli military.

>But as horrific as Israel’s war on Gaza in 2014 was and as clear a turning point in the polls as it turned out to be, its impact will probably pale in comparison with the impact of the genocidal war Israel has been carrying out in Gaza for the last 10 months. This campaign of mass atrocities has gone on for nearly seven times as long as the war in 2014 and killed a far, far greater number of Palestinians in the process with some estimates of more than 186,000 dead. Indeed, polls have already shown that most Democrats believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. That is the consensus that is increasingly shared across the world with dozens of states, including Brazil, Spain, Slovenia, Mexico and many more joining South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the international court of justice.

>Not only is this war so much more destructive than that of 2014, but it has consequently meant that far more imagery of the sadism of Israeli troops committing war crimes in Gaza, often posted by the troops themselves, have riffled around the world on TikTok, Instagram and other social media sites, giving people everywhere a chance to bear witness to their brutality. We saw what the decade after 2014 looked like for public opinion on Israel – can you imagine what the next decade will look like after these horrors? Aipac can, and that is precisely why they are terrified. They are attempting to plug a hole in the proverbial dyke with millions in campaign donations, but their problem isn’t akin to a leak, it is a rising tide of anger and disgust over Israeli crimes that will shape a generation to come",Insultikarp,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/07/us-support-for-israel-is-collapsing-and-aipac-knows-it,/r/mopolitics/comments/1eqfsol/us_support_for_israel_is_collapsing_and_aipac/,1,2024-08-12 14:52:44,6,,False,0.75,None,2024-09-14 12:19:41.588844

Askpolitics,1fej831,Why isn’t voting integrity open source?,"I cant seem to find a lot of information online about this, but one question I always had is that with 21st century technology, why can’t a US citizen submit their vote and receive a sort of receipt that verified their vote was counted.

Then they can take that receipt that includes their ballot results along with their name and identifiable information, and hashes it. This way their vote remains anonymous, but still is uniquely identifiable to trace back to their paper ballot

Then the voter takes that hash and can use some sort of open source voting software and verify that their vote is included in the blockchain voting system.


I guess Im confused why this doesn’t exist, but instead lies a lot of ambiguity in the election process, where votes are counted and submitted by jurisdictions and theres many hands in the process.

This would help debunk any conspiracies that could arise again this year like we seen in 2020. But instead its just a blackbox to ordinary citizens that trust in the government process to uphold a fair and transparent election 


Ive found other threads discussing the same deal, but commenters are shooting it down by rebutting with arguments that dont apply.

For instance, how fo you explain this to your grandma? Well how do we currently explain the process? We dont. We just trust in it.

Another comment mentions, “this doesnt prove that someone is eligble to vote”

This argument isnt relevant as i am only focused on securing the system of record and verifying votes are counted.

Askpolitics,1f5a897,"Why is it such a common occurrence for products, media, etc. that is targeted specifically towards Democrats to fail?","For quite a while there has a pretty consistent trend with companies doing advertising, creating media, etc. that embraces beliefs primarily held by Democrats, and in more instances than not it seems to backfire and result in that company losing profits. With some instances, such as with the Bud Light controversy it can be explained with the fact that they drove off a portion of their current consumers and failed to bring in a notable amount of new consumers. Same applies with the Target boycott, they drove off their customers and couldn't bring in enough new customers to make up for the ones they lost

That being said, there are a lot of instances where the loss of profits doesn't make sense. Disney released a new Star Wars show, The Acolyte. Democrats are a majority by a pretty sizeable margin when it comes to young adults, who also make up a large majority of those who consume media the most. With that being the case, the people that are being driven away by the inclusivity in The Acolyte shouldn't make up enough of their target audience for it to have as big of an impact as it did. Same applies to video games such as Concord and Dustborn

Another thing of note is that a lot of companies that take a stance against beliefs commonly held by Democrats seem to have a lot of success. Obviously for some of those companies their primary consumer base is made up of Republicans so they aren't taking much of a loss but even companies without a pre established consumer base seem to have a massive amount of success as well

So basically, what I want is some potential explanations for why this seems to happen so frequently. Is it a matter of marketing? Are the statistics wrong, and younger generations are actually majority Republican? Is it simply that Republicans have more money to throw around, or perhaps that Democrats feel far less inclined to support their beliefs monetarily? I'm sure there is a reasonable answer, but I simply can't seem to find one that is backed up by evidence",Epicfrog50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askpolitics/comments/1f5a897/why_is_it_such_a_common_occurrence_for_products/,/r/Askpolitics/comments/1f5a897/why_is_it_such_a_common_occurrence_for_products/,14,2024-08-31 00:10:04,3,,False,0.6,None,2024-09-14 12:19:43.045811

Askpolitics,1f371l4,"I asked AI to write a government structure based on Maslow’s Law, which idea is your hang up from the ideas below?","### 1. **Basic Physiological Needs**
   - **Focus:** The government’s first priority would be ensuring that all citizens have access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and healthcare.
   - **Policies:** 
     - Universal healthcare.
     - Food security programs.
     - Affordable housing initiatives.
     - Clean water and sanitation infrastructure.
   - **Institutions:** Ministries or departments specifically dedicated to ensuring the availability of these essentials, with robust safety nets for the most vulnerable populations.

### 2. **Safety Needs**
   - **Focus:** After securing basic needs, the government would emphasize the importance of safety and security.
   - **Policies:** 
     - Strong law enforcement with a focus on community policing.
     - National defense systems that prioritize the safety of citizens without excessive militarization.
     - Disaster preparedness and emergency response services.
     - Workplace safety regulations and social security systems.
   - **Institutions:** National safety boards, emergency management agencies, and defense ministries.

### 3. **Social Belonging Needs**
   - **Focus:** The government would promote social cohesion and community building, ensuring that citizens feel connected and valued.
   - **Policies:** 
     - Support for community centers, cultural events, and public spaces where people can gather.
     - Education systems that emphasize social skills, cooperation, and emotional intelligence.
     - Programs that encourage civic engagement and volunteerism.
     - Policies promoting inclusion and diversity to ensure all groups feel a sense of belonging.
   - **Institutions:** Ministries of culture, education, and community development.

### 4. **Esteem Needs**
   - **Focus:** The government would help citizens build self-esteem and gain recognition for their achievements.
   - **Policies:** 
     - Educational and vocational programs that help individuals develop skills and gain qualifications.
     - Public recognition of achievements through awards, honors, and other forms of acknowledgement.
     - Economic policies that ensure fair wages, job security, and opportunities for career advancement.
     - Support for mental health services to help individuals build self-confidence and overcome challenges.
   - **Institutions:** Departments of education, labor, and mental health.

### 5. **Self-Actualization Needs**
   - **Focus:** At the highest level, the government would strive to help individuals reach their full potential and pursue personal growth.
   - **Policies:** 
     - Funding for the arts, research, and creative endeavors.
     - Lifelong learning opportunities through public libraries, online education platforms, and community colleges.
     - Encouragement of innovation and entrepreneurship through grants, incubators, and support networks.
     - Environmental policies that ensure the preservation of nature for future generations to explore and enjoy.
   - **Institutions:** Ministries of innovation, education, culture, and environmental conservation.

### **Governance Structure**
   - **Council of Needs:** A governing body representing each tier of needs, ensuring that policies at every level of government align with the overall goal of fulfilling human needs. This council would work to balance resources and efforts across all tiers.
   - **Data-Driven Decision Making:** The government would heavily rely on data to monitor the fulfillment of needs, allowing for adjustments in policies and resource allocation as necessary.
   - **Citizens' Participation:** Regular input from citizens would be crucial, with mechanisms in place for them to voice their needs and concerns at each level of the hierarchy.

### **Overall Philosophy**
   - **Human-Centric Governance:** The government's core philosophy would be centered on human well-being, with every policy and initiative designed to meet the hierarchy of needs and promote overall happiness and fulfillment.
   - **Progressive Realization:** Policies would be designed to progressively move citizens up the hierarchy, ensuring that basic needs are met before addressing higher-level needs.

Now with the DNC, it’s the same story: a big concert with slogans and populist topics, just in opposition to the RNC.

As an outsider, I don’t understand why there’s such a lack of real policy discussion from either side. In Australia, we don’t have this kind of spectacle leading up to elections.

It just seems mad to me with all the post 9/11 airport security etc that that amount of people would be allowed to be on the runway like that,  it must be an absolute logistics nightmare at the very least!

Askpolitics,1epq7vh,Did Musks endorsement of Trump do more harm than good for his campaign?,"When Musk endorsed Trump, it was a blatant ""buy the politician"" moment.  Trump bent the knee to Musk pretty much immediately.  It's ironic that the media accused Musk of bending the knee.  We all know the hierarchy here puts Musk at the top of the machine given his astronomical wealth.  He is a puppeteer on the grand scheme.  

This blatantly paints Trump as a figure that will do favors for people if they spend, which goes against what he stood for - drain the swamp, rattle the establishment etc - but it's pretty clear he's just filling the swamp with different water and creating a new establishment with all the same problems.  Musk bought Trump.  This breaks the logic that built him up in the first place.
