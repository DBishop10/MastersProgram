Paper should be 4-8 pages long, IEEE format

Shift to discussing both amount discussed online as well as contents????


Ideas:

Compare Professional Athletes performances post game launches/events, can we determine who might be playing too many video games?

esport compare player and team sentiment to performances, also look at what players/teams are posting before the matches. Could look to multiple games?


eSports Tournament Sentiment:
    Compare sentiment toward teams or players during major eSports tournaments to traditional sports tournaments.
    Hypothesis: Sentiment in eSports fandoms is more polarized compared to traditional sports.
This one may be too close to the basketball one, maybe look specifically at performances on rivalry/beef matches

Compare sentiment and volume of tweets before and after the launch of a new streaming platform or major series.

Compare social media sentiment about major tech releases (e.g., iPhone vs. Samsung) over time.

Compare sentiment toward emerging technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain) across time or demographic groups.

Analyze sentiment trends within major fan groups (e.g., sports teams, music artists, or video games) to identify whether larger fanbases are more prone to toxicity.

Abstract (problem, method, findings)
Introduction (the research question and why it’s important)
Background (what have others done relevant to research question and why it’s insufficient)
Methodology (method/approach are you doing to contribute to the research question)
Findings/results (results of your analysis/data)
Conclusions & Recommendations (what’s the “so what”, what are limitations, future research, and end with a positive statement)
References (Do not describe your journey of discovery. Focus on succinctly communicating repeatable research finding)  




Key Analyses
Correlation Between Post Count and Performance

Investigate whether teams with more community engagement (higher post_count) perform better (performance = 1).
Visualization: Scatter plot of post_count vs. performance.
Sentiment Breakdown and Performance

Examine whether a higher proportion of positive posts (positive_posts / post_count) is associated with winning.
Compare the average positive_posts and negative_posts for teams that won vs. teams that lost.
Visualization: Bar plot comparing sentiment breakdown (positive_posts, negative_posts, neutral_posts) between winning and losing teams.
Sentiment Ratios as Predictors

Calculate sentiment ratios (e.g., positive_posts / (positive_posts + negative_posts)).
Analyze the relationship between these ratios and performance.
Visualization: Box plot or histogram of sentiment ratios for winning vs. losing teams.
Total Sentiment Impact

Create a "weighted sentiment score": \text{weighted sentiment} = 2 \cdot \text{positive_posts} - 2 \cdot \text{negative_posts} + \text{neutral_posts}.
Compare the weighted sentiment score between winning and losing teams.
Visualization: Scatter plot of weighted sentiment scores vs. performance.
Top Performers vs. Low Performers

Compare teams with performance = 1 (winners) and performance = 0 (losers) on all metrics (post_count, positive_posts, negative_posts, neutral_posts).
Visualization: Summary statistics table or grouped bar chart.

Things to mention to do better:
Dig into twitch stream chats, probably more informative there
