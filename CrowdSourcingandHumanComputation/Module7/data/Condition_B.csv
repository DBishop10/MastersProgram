Several years ago, he developed an
opioid addiction following an injury that progressed to regular heroin use. He completed treatment and
appears to be recovered and is doing pretty well. Jim works at a job in a local business. He earns $54,000 a year before taxes and is doing well enough. He
is well groomed and known for dressing neatly. At his job, he gets along well with his co-workers and is on friendly terms with them. He begins his days
chatting briefly with the people he works with and then gets down to business. He takes coffee and lunch
breaks during the day, just like everyone else, and returns to work when his coworkers do.
Every once in a while Jim becomes frustrated with all the demands at work and says he feels anxious about
them. Once when he felt this way, he got red in the face, went to a back room, and began pacing and
complaining to a co-worker in an angry tone of voice. Later, he talked to some of the people he works with
about the pressures he is sometimes under.
Jim is interested in meeting and dating young women in the community. He is considering joining a local
church group to meet them. He is also looking for a job that gives him more responsibility and pays better
than his current one.
