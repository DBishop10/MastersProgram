I don't specifically know why but I could not grasp SEDS or SEWDS for a very long part of this project and felt like I was just guessing things to work. Even now while I completed the project I am unsure if I actually did it in the correct manner. I think I grasp both SEDS and SEWDS well enough. The biggest issue for me was the initial problem. At this point I am fairly certain that you can only find (0,2) with state space search and not SEDS or SEWDS. I personally could not find a path that either algorithm would have found (0,2) as I would always eliminate it, however if there was a way I would love to know it as I think that hindered me the most. Very interesting project and module however, honestly quite fun (especially with the tic tac toe stuff for the Self Check)."
