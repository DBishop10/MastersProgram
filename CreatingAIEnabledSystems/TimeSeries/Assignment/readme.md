Management needs improved forecasts in two key areas: overall transactions and fraudulent transactions.  This not only provides insights into business growth and theft but also is useful in the future to understand the impacts of various activities aimed at increasing sales and decreasing theft.  Additionally, management needs to understand fraud at higher resolution to identify key factors in theft.  You must choose an acceptable way to aggregate the data - weekly, monthly, etc. and add features that improve the forecast.  The earlier fraud data file has been updated to contain 5 full years.   You can get it hereLinks to an external site..

You must supply two model types each of the four areas below.

- A traditional and deep model that forecasts the number of total transactions including fraudulent ones.  Compare results for each model.
- A traditional and deep model that forecasts the number of fraudulent transactions. Compare results for each model.
- A traditional and deep model that forecast the number of total transactions with the addition of an extra feature - justify the feature.  Compare to the model results in 1.
- A traditional and deep model the forecasts the number of transactions and fraudulent transactions given a selected (you select with justification) sub-feature such as a specific product category, location, amount range, and such.  Summarize your findings.
- Create a web service that takes a date in the future and forecasts the number of total transactions and fraudulent transactions (keep within a month of the last date)

Your work includes the python scripts to accomplish above and notebooks that provide a tour of the python and comparisons notes.
